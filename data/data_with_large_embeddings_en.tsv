The patient underwent surgery with proximal nephrectomy.
In the nephrectomy specimen, the renal parenchyma was replaced in its entirety by a heterogeneous whitish lesion in which cystic cavities of necrotic appearance combined with hemorrhagic foulish formations could be observed.
Upon cutting, a firm consistency was observed, mainly with the white areas corresponding to cracksaceas, although in other locations a soft consistency was observed, even crux.
The histological study showed a neoplasm consisting of a proliferation of spindle cells and polygonal cells marked with atypical nuclear pleomorphism, adopting a solid growth pattern.
More than 75% of it showed differentiation to osteochondroma and chondrosarcoma, although we could also demonstrate scaly differentiation, mainly covering the internal surface of the cystic formations previously described.
The high cellular atypia observed became more evident with the presence of abundant multinucleated giant cells located within the solid fusiform areas and around the osteosarcomatous differentiation areas are atypical (14).
The tumor contacted the renal capsule without exceeding it, establishing vascular structures of the hilium and adipose tissue of the pelvis.
After rigorous sampling of the surgical specimen, few foci with histological pattern of clear cell carcinoma could be observed.
The immunohistochemical study of the neoplasia showed positive immunostaining for cytokeratins both in the clear cell component and in the fusocellular being the latter equally positive for vimentin (13).
With all this the diagnosis of renal sarcomatoid carcinoma was emitted with predominance of areas with heterologous malignant differentiation (osteo and chondrosarcoma), referring to the presence of foci of carcinoma with clear cell pattern.

Ultrasonography showed no abnormalities of interest, except for a proband growth (prostate of approximately 65 grams).
PSA's 223.
Prostate biopsy detects 6 cylinders markedly infiltrated by a Gleason VII adenocarcinoma.
Staging bone scintigraphy showed no evidence of bone pathology. Complete androgen deprivation was initiated with antiandrogens and LH-RH analogues (August 2000).
During follow-up, PSA levels gradually increased (APC 2001: 0.5, August 2001: 0.7, February 2002: 6.4, April 2002: 14), with no worsening of the patient's general condition.
In February and April 2002, the patient came to the emergency department with two episodes of hematuria and urinary retention, requiring catheterization for one month.
Progressively, the obstructive symptoms worsened in two months, reaching the Orifice for Goteo in June 2002.
The flowmetric study in May 2002 shows a maximum flow rate of 2 ml/sec, with recurrence rate of 80 ml.
Due to this clearly obstructive worsening of his disease, transurethral resection of the prostate was proposed.
In July 2002, when the entrance urethra was introduced to perform the resection of the prostate, a penile urethra filled in a mamelon shape of 0.5-1 cm, polypoid, large caliber bladder was observed.
The rest of the bulbar urethra and prostatic urethra is normal, something destructured the latter.
R.T.U. is not performed because of difficult vision.

In July 2002 after verifying a PSA of 22, antiandrogens were withdrawn, maintaining the analogues and including the patient in an Atrasentan trial (M00-244).
The persistence of severe obstructive symptoms justified a resection of the urethral and prostate glands, sending both samples separately to the department of pathological anatomy to obtain the histological filiation of the former.
Bladder catheterization was maintained for 3 weeks.
The histological diagnosis of the urethral tissue was: masses exclusively formed by an adenocarcinoma Gleason X. The diagnosis was the same in relation to the prostatic tissue itself.

Two liquid formations were found in the pelvis.
The largest measured 3.4 cm in its longitudinal axis, in the right parasagittal area, the second collection measured 1 cm in its longitudinal axis.
The formation of a cm in diameter was of the same characteristics and was between the middle parasagittal and sagittal areas.
It was not possible to document a relationship with the urethra in the other sequences.
The impression was of a large urethral diverticulum of at least 3.5 x 2.5 cm, however, it could not be ruled out that the smallest collection was a cyst of the Barino gland.
1.
Flexible cystourethroscopy under anesthesia showed a large urethral diverticulum at 10 mm from the bladder neck.
At compression, there was no drainage through the urethra.
Cystourethroscopy with 12 and 70 degrees optics showed two ostium in the middle urethra at 7 o'clock.
The ostium was a few millimeters apart.
The rest of the urethra showed no abnormalities.
Macroscopically, the diverticulum did not compromise the bladder neck or deform the trigone.
Cystoscopy showed both normal and orthotopic ureteral orifices.
No alterations were found in the rest of the bladder.
The diagnostic impression was a complex urethral diverticulum with two ostia at 7 o'clock in the cystoscopy time in the middle urethra.
A urethral resection was indicated.
The patient was previously informed of the risks of the procedure, including urethrovaginal fistula, urethral stricture, urinary incontinence and possible subsequent reconstructive surgery.

General anesthesia.
Lithotomy position.
Sterilization and preparation of the external genital field in the usual manner.
Sedative fixators on the minor lips to expose the anterior vaginal wall.
Anterograde placement of a 16 French supra-plus cystostomy tube was performed using Lowsley's grading system.
The balloon of this catheter was inflated 7 ml of sterile water and left as drainage seriously throughout the operation.
Placement of a 16 Fr Foley urethral catheter in the urinary bladder
Cystoscopy confirmed the preoperative diagnosis.
The anterior vaginal wall was infiltrated with a total of 15 ml of saline solution containing lidocaine and epinephrine.
An incision was made in the urethra and a flap of the anterior vaginal wall was dissected until the periurethral fascia was exposed.
A horizontal incision was made in the periurethral fascia and a plane between the urethral diverticulum and the periurethral fascia was carefully dissected.
The diverticulum wall was thick and indurated.
The diverticulum was dissected to the level of its own neck.
The diverticular neck was dissected just at the tip of the urethra, exposing the previously placed Foley urethral catheter.
The urethra edges were approached by continuously sutured the urethral mucosa with 3-0 Vycril.
In the horizontal plane periurethral fascia was excised with loose points of Vicryl.
Anterior vaginal flap was used as the last layer.
Since there was an excess of anterior vaginal wall tissue that would recombine the diverticulum, the excess was removed and anterior vaginal incision was closed with continuous 2-0 Vicryl suture.
The Foley urethral catheter was left in place and the suprapump cystotomy became severe.
To point out the great difficulty of dissection of the diverticulum that was measured 4 cm in length, mainly due to the difficulty to dissect the entire path to the neck of the diverticulum.

In the hours after the intervention, the intensity of hematuria was increased, introducing continuous bladder lavage and intravenous treatment with E-aminocaproic, which did not resolve the condition resulting in a progressive transfusion.
Subsequently, the intensity of hematuria subsided, although within two weeks after the intervention, it was repeated as self-limiting episodes that partially resolved with conservative measures.
Six days after surgery, an ultrasound showed occupation by an image suggesting clotting and cystoscopy, which was inconclusive due to the intraoral occupation of a large clot.
During the exploration, a washout attempt was made which was unsuccessful due to pain, and it was only possible to explore the area of the anal cavity, observing a clot-forming wheat that was abolished by the left ureteral meatus.
The following imaging tests were requested: intravenous urography, which showed the normality of both systems known as localised clots, which appeared slightly ectatic due to the presence of multiple bladder filling defects.
The CT did not provide further information, with findings similar to the previous examination, ruling out pathology of the upper urinary tract.

In the anamnesis, the patient did not report pain in the renal fossa, hematuria, episodes of urinary infection or asthenia, anorexia or weight loss.
Physical examination revealed no abdominal masses or enlargement.
Ultrasound showed an exophytic nodule of 4 x 2 cm in diameter larger at the upper pole of the right kidney that presents solid and cystic areas with vascularized areas (Eco-doppler).
Diagnosis of a complex renal mass requires a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis of a complex cystic lesion at the renal level, making it impossible to definitively determine its benign nature.
We performed an abdominal MRI that identified a mass of 4.2 x 3.3 x 3 cm, hypointense on T1-weighted sequences and markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences, with multiple linear cystic septa administered inside the cyst.

Three days after admission the patient reported sudden onset tinnitus accompanied by significant bilateral hearing loss.
The patient did not present vertigo or instability.
There was no earache or otodynia or sensation of ear fullness.
Facial mobility was preserved.
Physical examination revealed normal hearing loss, with profound audiometry of the right ear and cophosis of the left ear, with normal impedance.
1.
Once the neurosensory character of hearing loss was confirmed, a review of the patient's medical history and a new anamnesis were performed to perform the etiological study.
After excluding the relationship with systemic diseases, intracranial infections and trauma, hearing loss was attributed to the administration of intravenous furosemide in the initial management of septic shock.
Furosemide was discontinued and the association of other ototoxic drugs was prescribed.
We proceeded according to the protocol of sudden hypoacusis to treatment with parenteral corticosteroids at high doses (Methylprednisolone 120 mg/24) and oral pentoxyphylline.
(400 mg/ 8 h).
After 7 days of parenteral treatment oral corticosteroids were continued in descending order for 14 additional days (Prednisone 60 mg/day 7 days and 30 mg/day 7 days), maintaining the same dose for pentoxyphylline.
The audiometry at two weeks of treatment showed improvement of tonal hearing with the appearance of severe auditory remains in the left ear and the rise of thresholds in the right ear.

"A 68-year-old patient with a history of severe mental retardation and deafness secondary to meningitis in childhood.
She presented to our emergency department with pain and inflammation in the left hemiscrotum of more than 3 weeks duration, which did not cease despite antibiotic treatment and antiscrotum.
On examination, a generalized increase in content and more pronounced on the left side was observed, with painful consolidation test, thickened epididymis surface and firm consistency.
The right testicle was normal.
Urine sediment revealed pyuria.
Ultrasound showed an enlarged, heterogeneous left test, with an area in medial position with multiple cystic cavities, some of them hypoechogenic.
Evolving orchitis was diagnosed and the patient was discharged with analgesic anti-inflammatory treatment.
Eight days later, the patient came for a review in the urology clinic, where the consolidation clearly defined a nodule, which suggested a differential diagnosis with testicular neoplasia.
A left radical orchiectomy was performed, after determination of tumor markers (b-HCG, alpha-fetoprotein and LDH), which were normal.
Macroscopically, the section surface of the orchiectomy specimen showed thickening of the tunica albuginea, with hemorrhagic zones.
Testicular parenchyma was increased in consistency, with presence of white fibrotic tracts and plaques.
Microscopic examination revealed hypospermatogenesis marked by hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules, as well as a chronic inflammatory process consisting of histiocytes, abundant plasma cells and giant cells.
Within some of these cells, the characteristic bodies of Michaelis-Gutmann with a ""bud eye"" appearance were recognized, which were positive for calcium MLP, thus suggesting its von Kos staining.
These inflammatory changes also partially affected the epididymis.
With the diagnosis of testicular and epididymal PLM, treatment was completed with a fluoroquinolone regimen for 3 months, after which the evolution is satisfactory and the patient is asymptomatic.

Clinically, the patient complained of abdominal pain, asthenia and weight loss.
He had no hematuria or voiding syndrome.
Physical examination revealed a large abdominal mass.
Laboratory tests (systematic blood analysis, blood and urine biochemistry, coagulation) were normal.
Testicular ultrasound confirmed a significant left varicocele; abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography (CT and abdominal vein) showed a mass in the left kidney, 25 × 20 × 14 cm in maximum diameter, with abdominal structures displacing
The rest of the examination was normal (T2N0).

The study was completed with a bone scintigraphy (negative for bone metastases), aspiration puncture (needle aspiration), abdominal dislodgement, and arteriography of malignancy).
In view of the study results, it was decided to perform a radical nephrectomy; the intervention was uneventful and the postoperative period was favorable; the patient was discharged 7 days after surgery.
The pathology report described macroscopically a large encapsulated tumor mass of 4,960 g, measuring 27 × 23 × 15 cm, where no kidney was recognized.
The microscopic description confirmed the diagnosis of fibromyxoid renal sarcoma.
Subsequent payment
Followed in outpatient consultation by urology services and non-physician (which decides not to give treatment), the patient is very well and all complementary examinations performed 9 months after the intervention (analytical abdominal CT blood tests).
Three months later an extensive local recurrence was detected in the abdominal CT scan, a mass in the left renal cell with local extension (non-apparently, 20 cm) affecting the spleen and pancreas that displaces but did not appear.

It was decided to treat a large multiloculated tumor involving the spleen, the tail of the pancreas, the greater curvature of the stomach and the left diaphragm.
A resection of the tumor was performed, including the affected diaphragm, a sleeve gastrectomy to the angle of His, a cholecystectomy with resection of the tail of the pancreas and a colectomy of the splenic flexure.
The pathology report confirmed that it was an abdominal and retroperitoneal recurrence of high grade sarcoma, compatible with fibrosarcoma, adhered to the gastric wall, the spleen and pancreas.
Treatment was completed with chemotherapy (6 cycles-adriamycin/ifosfamide/month) and radiotherapy, which showed good tolerance and response (control CT within normal limits).
After four months, she had a new recurrence observed on abdominal CT, so she received chemotherapy and 8 months later the patient died.

Aneurysm of the infrarenal abdominal aorta is incidentally diagnosed on ultrasound scans performed with barefoot.
Median CT was found not to affect the iliac bifurcation.
Likewise, in this exploration kidneys with morphology compatible with horseshoe kidneys, with isthmus located at the level of the infrarenal abdominal aorta are observed.
Our case reveals the situation, in principle, more favorable at the time of the surgical approach, since the aneurysm originates distally at 4 cm from the exit of the main renal arteries, which are two half, one for each one.
There is no additional artery at the level of the isthmus.
In successive controls, a progressive increase in aortic diameter was observed, which, in a control CT scan, had reached a maximum diameter of 8 cm.

A baseline echocardiogram and respiratory function tests were performed within the preoperative aneurysm protocol, all of them without significant alterations.
We opted for a retroperitoneal approach with resection of the infrarenal aortic aneurysm and bypass graft with a 16-mm Hemazeld prosthesis, without intraoperative complications.
Neither lumbar nor polar arteries were visualized.
The postoperative course is normal, with no complications arising from the procedure, and the patient maintains adequate renal function.

The patient underwent tidal volumes of 800 ml (volume/minute 10 lpm) and voiding was 96%.
We then measured the static compliance of each lung (25 ml/cm H2O in the right lung and 15 ml/cm H2O in the left lung), because we decided to start washing the left lung with the worst compliance (the patient).
Washing was performed with isotonic saline solution heated to 37o C. A liter was infused from a height of 30 cm on the patient and drained by gravity.
The same operation was performed until the lavage fluid was cleared.
Thirteen units were needed in this first phase.
To achieve a better result and drainage thoracic percussion was performed on the washed lung.

"T. I. is a 38-year-old woman who arrived at our unit, derived from a psychiatric unit of another hospital in Barcelona, for psychotic symptoms.
The patient suffered burns due to burns in her home that required a month of admission to the unit.
The patient reported no personal or family history of mental illness.
Likewise, toxic consumption.
The predominant antecedents were cesarean section five months ago, surgical wound infection, and second and third degree burns caused by the aforementioned.
The patient's psychobiography revealed that she was born in Casabla (Marruecos) and the sixth in nine brothers (5 men and 4 women).
Schoolchildren are up to twenty years old with good academic achievement (high school graduate and high school graduate), plus two years of complementary education.
The socio-occupational adjustment in his country was correct (several temporary jobs such as azafata, dependant, sport monitor, etc.).
She was married in her country a year and a half ago by family agreement (before she had never had a male partner or friends), and a month later she lived in the province of Girona (Spain) with her husband.
Since her marriage the patient devoted herself to household chores.
Your first child (a male) was born five months ago in a complicated delivery.
Two months ago, the patients home was declared ill-defined, which led to his admission to the psychiatric inpatient unit of a hospital.
Upon admission to our unit the patient was alert, conscious and disoriented temporo-spatially.
The contact with the patient was psychotic; her speech was scarce, in a low voice and with a monotonous tone of voice.
He referred a loss delirium and paranoid that did not specify us.
He was suspicious.
He reported hypothymia, fear dysthymia, and hearing loss in the form of ""noise"".
The examination showed poor fixation memory.
In the successive interviews with the patients spirits (some of them with the help of a translator), she said that two months after delivery she began a mood disorder that ranged between sadness or crying and crying.
Progressively there was a delusion of prejudice against her and her child, as well as hearing aids in the form of voces that criticized and gave orders.
In relation to this psychotic clinic, the patient explained anguish and intense fear of suffering damage (she or her child) as well as her voluntary isolation as a protective measure.
When exploring the hours prior to admission to the ED, the patients consciousness level and memory loss were explained by the fact that the patients suspicion could not be ruled out.
During his stay in the acute care unit, pharmacological treatment with Haloperidol was established up to 11.5 mg/d (with progressive dose reduction), Amisulpride (hasta Clocepna 800 mg/d.) and
A few hours after admission he was alert, conscious and oriented.
The first days the patient still suffers from fearfulcondition and itspicious, not leaving his room.
Slowly it improved contact, affection and psychotic symptoms; progressively disappearance of beliefs and took distance from delusional content to criticize it.
It gradually adapted to the dynamics of the unit.
It was considered key for the treatment and recovery of the patient to facilitate early and continued contact with their child and permissions to the family home; in fact, early maternal-filial contact was an important factor that accelerated the recovery.
Permissions were uneventful and the family adequately collaborated at all times.
Upon discharge, the patient was euthymic, had no positive psychotic psychopathology and was able to take care of her child (although confusion persisted). She was also suffering from secondary psychosis.
The patient and her family raised the possibility of performing her convalescence in Morocco, which we consider beneficial because it would be attended by professionals with the same therapeutic language and culture and would count on the support of her family of origin.

Manic and depressive episodes are alternated requiring some of them hospital admission, although they can develop normal life without occupational affectation between periods until the third of their income in the year 2006, motivated by a recent episode of disabling mental illness in the patient.
Relapse was always related to treatment discontinuation with Litio.
Alcohol abuse is also observed during this time.
The diagnosis until December 2009 was: ""Biopolar Disorder with psychotic symptoms with and without psychotic symptoms remission"" and ""Alcohol abuse"".
Since she is ill-defined, only her parents and siblings are related, due to her lifestyle and manic symptomatology, she is considered the ""black sheep"" of the family.
In 2009 she suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
CT scan revealed left temporoparietal involvement surrounded by wide edema; mass effect on the ipsilateral ventricular system and acute left parietal hematoma with severe impairment of the level of consciousness, sensitivity, motor skills and speech.
When she woke up from the coma she says that the first thing she sees is the face of an old teacher companion who united her a relationship of affection.
After this he says that his brothers ""are not his brothers"", attributing the change to the friend professor.
CD is susceptible to friends and acquaintances.
Abandoned by his partner at that time, he will be the brother who becomes disabled of his care.

Subsequently, it requires several hospitalizations due to psychiatric symptoms; there are practically no asymptomatic periods.
At the acute care unit upon admission to the EMU, the patient presented mild insomnia, psychosis with idea of paranoidthymic, affective, kinesthetic, social isolation, and hyperesic isolation.
Lithium salts were removed due to nephropathy secondary to diabetes insipidus, and valproic acid was established.
Diagnosis: 'Schizoaffective mixed disorder, with psychotic symptoms with psychotic features and not with mental disorders'; 'Alcohol abuse'.
In February 2012 she was admitted to the EMU to start a ""individualized rehabilitation plan"".
• Medical evaluation revealed moderate functional limitation with generalized hypotonia.
History of hypothyroidism and NID-DM, both in remission.
Potomania and enuresis secondary to episodes of nephrogenic insipid diabetes that were corrected with self-recording and thiazides.
• Neuropsychological examination (WAIS IV) showed cognitive impairment both in working memory and processing speed, although levels reflect a ""normal"" level, around 100 CI, is presupposed with much higher academic history.
He had socially undesirable verbal behaviors that would suggest frontal affectation, perhaps consequent to the manifestation of abusive alcohol consumption.
• Psychopathological assessment: Presence of several delusions, of bodily influence, of telepathy and CD, and a phenomenon called simple warning.
The same professor who provokes identity supplantation also takes things out and pushes him.
It communicates telepathically with it through the numbers displayed on TV and the clicks heard in the crystals.
The characteristics of CD are shown in Table 1.
It should be noted that although at first there was some hostility towards the ""double of the brother"", the feelings became positive, now it is much better with him than before the episode of SAH.

In July 2008, she was diagnosed with primary amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome.
At hospital discharge he received nutritional recommendations from the Nephrology Department to perform a low-sodium and fat diet, as well as to exclude protein foods.
To do so, the patient was required to cook all foods, not to use table salt, and could not use any other culinary technique (cold, flat, roasted, microwave, etc.), and not eat.
The current pharmacological treatment includes enalapril, candesartán, atorvastatin, acetylsalicylic acid, ezetimibe, atorvastatin, barniquine, and NSAID.
Go to the diet therapy clinic to prescribe a diet adjusted to your nutritional needs.
In the initial consultation a nutritional history was carried out including a complete anthropometric, biochemical and analysis of intake through a 3-day dietary survey analyzed with the Dietsource 3.0®Nestlé Healthcare Nutrition (Edicion 2005).
The characteristics of basal intake are shown in Table I, along with nutritional recommendations for the patient with nephrotic syndrome: protein-restricted diet, salt and lipid profile rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.
The initial examination yielded the following results:
1.
• Antrop: weight 86.7 kg, height 171 cm, BMI 29.65 kg/m2.
Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (TANITA TBF): 56.4% fat mass ® 300.6%), 76.6 kg lean body mass (88.4%) and 10.1 kg (88.4%).
The patient had edema with fovea up to the knees.
• Analytical Protein: Creatinine: 0.95 (normal values 0.5-1.1) mg/dL, abnormal Glomerular test: > 3.6 ml/min), negative controls (m.2, P: 2.431 g normal

"38 year old male patient admitted to the Nutrition Unit due to chylous ascites.
He had a history of smoking and repeated nephritic colic.
8 months prior to our consultation, he was diagnosed with left testicular seminoma with retroperitoneal lymph nodes (stage II C).
Surgery was performed by left radical orchiectomy.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy with the BEP protocol (3 cycles of Bleomycin-Episplatinum-Etoposide, and a fourth cycle of Cisplatin-E, later on).
After chemotherapy there was a significant decrease in the size of the adenopathic mass (4.2 x 3 cm in its maximum diameter versus 11 x 6 cm initial), but in view of the persistence of the adenopathies it was decided to perform retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.
The procedure was uneventful in the immediate postoperative period, but three weeks after surgery the patient consulted for pain and abdominal discomfort.
Physical examination revealed a distended, hard, diffusely painful abdomen with signs of ascites.
Abdominal ultrasound showed significant ascites.
Abdominal computed tomography detected postsurgical changes of retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy and significant amount of free intra-abdominal fluid.
Defecation paracentesis was performed with extraction of 8,000 cc of ascitic fluid appearance resected triglycerides.The analysis of this fluid showed: leukocytes 508/mm3, Polymorphonuclear 14%, Mononuclear 86%,
Three paracentesis were performed on an extra weekly basis 3, evacuation 7, and 4 successive evacuations.
At the Nutrition Clinic, the patient reported moderate asthenia with a feeling of early post-pandrial plenity.
Physical examination revealed weight 66 kg, height 177 cm, ideal weight 79.2 kg, BMI 21.06, tricipital fold 12 mm (91.8% p50), normal abdominal circumference and pleural effusion 115 bpm (89% p50).
Serum levels showed: glucose 92 mg/dl (60-100), creatinine 1.2 mg/dl (0.8-1.3), 7.9 mg/dl positive serum creatinine (3.5-7.2), serum creatinine 1.280 mg/dl (0.8-1.30) normal serum ferritin (37 mg/dl), serum creatinine 150 mg / dl (3.5), serum creatinine + platelet count (3.5), serum creatinine + 32
The patient was diagnosed with mild protein-calorie malnutrition in the context of chylous ascites secondary to retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.
A hyperproteic diet was initiated with restriction of one specific fat supplement in 5-6 daily intakes along with MCT 20 ml daily, zinc sulfate 1 tablet daily, a multivitamin complex and 100 grams daily of MCT.
This supplement provides 424 kcal and 11.4 grams of protein per 100 grams.
With this therapeutic approach, the patient only required an evacuating paracentesis and 3 months later presented the following anthropometric data: weight 70.1 kg, triceps skinfold 13 mm of the arm 23 cm previously altered (93% p 50), muscle circumference

"A 59-year-old man was admitted in September 2008 with a diagnosis of postoperative chylothorax.
A history of sigma cancer, performing in July 2008 a liver metastasectomy, being necessary since then to perform various chylothorax evacuators (approximately extracted volume: 9,000 mL).
On admission, he reported asthenia, discomfort in the right hemithorax and mild respiratory distress.
Pleural effusion occupying two thirds of the right hemithorax was radiologically observed.
After a pleural drainage, 500 mL of a fluid with a quotient appearance was obtained in the first 24 hours, whose analysis was compatible with chylothorax3: cholesterol (COL) 60 mg/dL, pleural triglycerides (TG).
Conservative treatment was decided with absolute diet and chest drainage, consulting the Nutrition Area to start parenteral nutritional support.
1.
Nutritional assessment showed a 4% weight loss in the last two months (usually 74 kg; current 71 kg), albumin 2.6 g/dL, transferrin 154 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 16.6 mg/dL.
The patient presented slight loss of fat and muscle mass, together with reduced functional capacity in the last weeks; absence of edema, malleolus and signs or symptoms of specific subcutaneous deficit at home.
Dietary history without recent changes.
The nutritional situation was compatible with mild protein-energy malnutrition, considering the following plan of nutritional care:
• Objectives: To maintain the gastrointestinal tract at rest and prevent a higher degree of malnutrition in a patient with high nutrient losses by pleural drainage
• Nutritional requirements: Caloric needs estimated by the Berris-Benedict equation (correction factor 1.4), 2200 kcal/day; protein requirements 1.5 amino acids/kg/day
• Composition of parenteral nutrition formula (PN): Volume 2,500 ml; 120 g of amino acids; 300 g of glucose; 60 g of lipids (MCT/LCT); 2280 kcal total; vitamins and oligoelements
Despite treatment, pleural drainage remained stable in the first days, with a chylous appearance persisting.
The ultrasound showed loculated pleural effusion resulting in 200,000 IU urokinase for two consecutive days by the digestive endoscopy tube.
Because of persistent abundant chylous drainage, it was decided to start treatment with octreotide 100 mcg/8h subcutaneously.
Drainage was progressively reduced in the following days, changing to a serous aspect.
At the same time, the patient's general condition worsened, with abdominal discomfort, oliguria and hyperglycemia.
Suspicion of adverse reaction to octreotide was discontinued on day 4.
Biochemistry showed anemia (hemoglobin 9.4 g/dL; hematocrit 28.8%), leucopenia (2,390 leukocytes/microliters), thrombocytopenia (48,000/microliters), urea 59 mg/dL, total creatinine 0.6 mg/dL
1.
After discontinuation of octreotide, pleural drainage continued to decrease to 50 mL/24h, maintaining the serous aspect.
On day 19 of admission mixed feeding was started using mixed formula with fat (Clinut®; 1.25 kcal/mL); 13%dura proteins or diet with fat mL (Clinutut®; 1.25 kcal/mL); fruit pure juices.
In subsequent days, NE increased progressively up to 50% of estimated calorie needs (1,000 mL/day), diet was progressed with the introduction of roasted bread, skimmed-milk, gutted white fish or bread,
Parallel to this, inputs were reduced with PN.
On day 22, after 48 hours with no changes in pleural drainage, the stenting tube and the PN were removed.
The nutritional evolution was favorable, with a gain of 2 kg, not being able to objective improvement in visceral proteins in the persistence of high CRP (15.7 mg/dL).
At discharge, it was recommended to follow the same diet supplemented with a spoonful of sopera daily (10 g) sunflower oil to prevent essential fatty acid (AGE) deficiency.

"A 65-year-old patient with a history of alcoholism and chronic ethylic liver disease.
The patient was operated on in January 2008 for a stenosing adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, performing a subtotal colectomy and a terminal ileostomy in the right iliac fossa.
Eight months later intestinal transit reconstruction was performed with end-to-end anastomosis and ileostomy closure.
Shortly after (November 2008) the patient was admitted for fecal peritonitis, performing a resection of 1.5 meters of small intestine leaving definitive terminal ileostomy with rectal stump abandoned in the pelvis, without possibility of subsequent reconstruction.
Two months after the second intervention (January 2009), the patient was admitted again to the hospital due to acute renal failure and secondary electrolyte disturbances, together with an ileostomy output greater than 1500 ml/day.
At that time he was treated with Tramadol, Paracetamol, Oral Iron and a loop diuretic (Furosemide) due to the presence of lower limb edema.
Subsequently, the patient came back to the hospital on several occasions, being the emergency service affected by renal failure and lack of awareness, hospitalization and electrolyte disturbances, which resolved in the service itself and did not require hospitalization.
In July 2009, the patient came to the emergency department again due to worsening of her general condition, with significant asthenia, prostration, difficulty walking and oliguria.
Blood tests performed in the emergency department showed: Creatinine: 4 mg/dl (LN 0.6-1.40); Sodium: 113 meq (LN 135-145); Potassium: 6.7 mg / lP
After several days of parenteral rehydration, the patient is discharged.
Then, the diuretic was discontinued and treatment was initiated with orally disintegrating salts, Loperamide (2 mg/8 hours) and Magnesium salts (Lactato Magq a dose of 8 mmol/ l) per dose.
One week later, the patient suffered syncope at home with a fall to the ground and mild head trauma in the right frontal region.
Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient presented two episodes of tonic-clonic seizures with diazepam IV.
A few minutes later she suffered a third crisis, which is why she began treatment with intravenousphenytoin and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
A cranial CT scan showed minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left suprasylvian region secondary to CT.
ECG and chest X-ray showed no significant changes.
Analytical analysis showed ion Ca: 2.3 mg/dl (LN 3.9-5.2); 25-hydroxyvitamin D: 10 ng/ml (LioN 2.8 meq; Ponesium 0.5 mg/dl; Sodium 125 mg/dl).
IV treatment was initiated with rehydration therapy, as well as intravenous treatment with magnesium sulfate, calcium gluconate and potassium chloride to correct electrolyte deficits.
During his stay in the ICU he did not present new episodes of crisis or neurological focality, and at discharge in this service magnesium, calcium and potassium levels had normalized.
Interconsultation with the Nutrition Unit was then requested, aiming at the physical examination a weight of 63 Kg (usual weight one year before: 74 Kg), height 1.68 m, BMI 22.3 Kg/m2, along with signs of fat mass decrease.
During the 3 weeks that the patient was hospitalized, he was treated with dietary measures such as: stront diet, low fat and simple sugars, rest of 30 minutes after meals, fluid intake outside meals.
In addition, treatment was established with oral rehydration salts (Sueroral®), Loperamide (14 mg/day), Codeine (90 mg/day), oral Magnesium supplements (account for cardiac failure 60 meq).
The output by the ileostomy was at the beginning of 1500-2000 ml/day and at discharge 800-1000 ml/day.
Their nutritional status improved normalizing the following nutritional parameters: cholesterol, albumin, Prealbumin and protein binding.
Weight decreased from 63 kg to 61 kg, and there were no signs of malignant and pretibial edema.
At discharge, Mg levels were below normal, although relatively ""safe"" (Mg 1.3); with magnesiuria of 14.7 (LN 50-150), Sodium, Potassium, i Total Calcium.
In the last days of admission, it was decided to change Colecalciferol to Calcitriol (0.25 micrograms/day), in order to promote and improve magnesium absorption, maintaining oral calcium doses (1500 mg/day).
PTH levels at discharge were normalized (38pg/ml), as well as vitamin D levels (20ng/ml).
Currently the patient performs revisions in Nutrition consultation, presenting good general condition, debits for the ileostomy of 1000 + 200 ml/day; with medication levels of Mg within the normal range (1.9 mg/dl gradually reducing the rest of lactate).

From the mental health service, the patient is identified as a patient at high risk of suffering RS, given his/her condition and previous psychosocial problems (foot > 20% depression in a year, severe problems).
Associated complexity of acute renal failure and high risk of RS is recommended a progressive start of nutritional support adapting macronutrient intake to the real weight and not ideal of the patient.
Taking into account the recommendations of the main clinical guidelines for the prevention of RS6, prophylactic administration of thiamine is recommended, and parenteral nutrition is initiated with a calorie intake of approximately 15 39% kcal / kg of total protein intake of 22%.
During the first days, the intake of phosphate, potassium and magnesium is restricted due to renal hyperphosphatemia (phosphate 8.91 mg/dL), hyperkalemia (potassium 5.27 mEq/L) and hypermagnesemia.
On consecutive days, protein-caloric intake slowly increases, with special precaution with nitrogen intake during the first week due to renal failure.
From the tenth day onwards nutritional requirements are finally met.
The energy intake is 30 kcal/kg (calorie distribution of 48% proteins, 30% lipids and 22% proteins), with a protein intake of 1.6g/kg, adapted to the patient's metabolic situation.
During the first days the analytical and nutritional parameters evolve favorably in parallel to the improvement of renal function, until the appearance of abdominal sepsis and all the complications described above.

This year HPN is started using a totally implanted intravascular device.
She was being treated with Infliximab and corticosteroids.
The following year she was admitted several times due to febrile syndrome associated with abdominal pain, without an evident focus and considering the origin the disease itself.
Staphylococcus epidermis was isolated in several hemocultives in these hospitalizations.
The catheter was also sutured due to rupture, removing only the reservoir and proximal portion of the catheter when the distal portion fixed to the tissue was found, so a fragment of the superior vena cava was lodged in the site.
In February 2011, she presented similar characteristics with fever of 11 days of evolution and abdominal pain that progressed to septic shock and was admitted to the ICU.
A chest X-ray showed that the abandoned fragment of the catheter was located from the superior vena cava to the right ventricle.
The study was completed with an echocardiogram, which showed vegetations on the catheter from the atrium to the ventricle.
With the diagnosis of catheter endocarditis, antibiotic treatment was initiated with Daptomycin and Rifampicin, taking into account previous isolations of Staphylococcus epidermis, and underwent cardiac surgery to remove both catheters.
1.
Initially the patient developed multiorgan dysfunction without control of the septic picture despite antibiotic treatment.
A CT scan of the skull and abdomen was performed to look for other foci of infection with the following findings: subarachnoid hemorrhage, patchy condensations in the right lung and several splenic infarcts, all compatible with emboli.
In the surgical specimen there were several isolates: Staphylococcus epidermis in the functioning catheter and polymicrobial growth in the catheter with vegetation.
In this case, Staphylococcus epidermis was isolated, Ochoderma longda as Trichorderma.
With these results the antibiotic treatment was modified leaving with Linezolid, Imipenem and Caspoline finally controlling the septic picture.
The patient had a torpid evolution requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and stenosis, pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation by Acinetobacter baumannii and polyneuropathy of the critical patient.
After a 45-day ICU stay, all these processes were resolved and the patient could be transferred to a facility where he completed his recovery.

At that time the patient weighed 41.5 kg, 165 cm (BMI = 15).
During the subsequent period his weight fluctuated between 38 and 42 kg despite the nutritional follow-up suffering up to five admissions one of them due to intracavitary abscess and left intestinal fistula.
In November 2011 she underwent ileocecal resection with laterolateral anastomosis due to intestinal fistula.
Postoperatively, the patient developed secondary to imipenem and was admitted to the ICU.
The patient required parenteral nutritional support for 20 days.
In January 2012, the patient was admitted again due to multifactor grade III chronic renal failure. Nutritional treatment with a renal protection diet was established.
The clinical situation requires a new PN for 10 days due to uncontrollable vomiting and impossibility of oral intake.
In September 2012 she was readmitted due to a suprapuberty fistula, starting again PN with the objective of nutritionalizing the patient to face a new intervention, at that time, 169 cm = surgical re-nutrition kg.
On the thirteenth day, after gaining 4 kg, the patient developed an allergic condition that began with erythema and pruritus.
The antibiotic was discontinued (9 days with meropenem) and treatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines was administered.
The evolution remains torpid in the following hours, with the appearance of edema and difficulty breathing.
At that time, it was decided to discontinue NP with improvement in symptoms.
Given the essential need for preoperative nutrition, a protocol for reintroduction of PN is developed:
1.
Start of TPN with exclusive intake of amino acids, glucose and electrolytes, with an amino acid source different from the previous preparation.
Always start in the morning schedule with close monitoring of the patient.
2.
After 48 h, if there were no signs of allergy reappearance, add increasing amounts of lipids to the parenteral during the next 72 h.
3.
In case of good tolerance, evaluate the need to add vitamins and trace elements to the mixture.
PN was restarted with good tolerance and no complications, contributing towards day 4 complete PN with macronutrients and according to the patient's needs.
After objectifying nutritional recovery, surgical intervention was decided with poor postoperative evolution and need for admission to the Intensive Care Unit for the development of septic shock of abdominal origin and multiple organ failure that ends in the patient's death.

Three times the patient came to the emergency department.
There was only a slight increase in amylase (155 IU, normal < 100).
To attempt to reach a diagnosis, transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound, gastroscopy, and abdominal CT were performed.
All tests were normal.
Finally, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) was performed.
It was only observed that the common bile duct and Wirsung were separated into the duodenal wall.
Initially it was interpreted as a variant of normality that can appear in up to 24% normal subjects (1).
However, in view of the invalidation of the symptoms (the patient reported epigastric pain with all meals) he was proposed to realise an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
There was a history of allergy to contrast agents and prophylaxis with glucocorticoids was performed.
In the endoscopic image, the papilla presented an appearance obsccid.
The biliary tract was deeply cannulated and a guide wire of 25 inches was created to ensure access to the common bile duct.
Contrast was introduced for cholangiopancreatography from the same papillary orifice.
During the injection the papilla presented a visible distortion in the endoscopic image and appeared as a cystic structure in the cholangiography.
The Wirsung was also drawn during contrast injection, but was immediately tapered and was not reflected on the radiographs.
Chococele diagnosis was made and it was proceeded to seccion by biliary sphincterotomy.
The patient had no complications of endoscopic intervention and pain during ingestion has not reappeared after two years of follow-up.

On follow-up by the Ongoing Care Service there was no evidence of tumor recurrence, although the patient continued to receive chronic dexamethasone treatment.
The patient was admitted due to an increase in diarrhea along with fever of 38 oC base. The lesions in the lower limbs were described as pustular and blistery, and signs of pneumatic consolidation were confirmed by X-ray.
The fever and pneumonic condensation disappeared after treatment with levofloxacin for two weeks.
Similarly, pain, diarrhea and heart rhythm alterations disappeared after treatment with digitalis. Weakness of the lower limbs persisted, as well as lesions that extended into a necrotic, centrally erythematous, abdominal surface.
Neither the imaging techniques performed (cranial, thoracic and abdominal CT and bone scintigraphy) nor the bone marrow biopsy and biopsy showed metastatic lesions, nor tumor aspiration.
MRI of the spine showed osteomalacia; decreased 25-OH-D levels were observed.
This osteomalacia could be explained by intestinal malabsorption of vitamin D, pancreatic insufficiency or treatment with anticonvulsants, three circumstances that occurred simultaneously in this patient.
The hemocultive, urocultive and coprocultive were negative, as well as the serology of HIV and CMV.
For the diagnosis of dermatological lesions, samples were taken for pathology and microbiology.
The biopsy showed cells with foreign body inclusions suggestive of malignant disease or dermatophytosis.
The microbiological study confirmed the dermatophytosis, with the isolation of Trichobate menta (CDM) in the culture of the sample taken from the hand lesions, and Alternaria sp in the culture of the sample taken.
Treatment with itraconazole was initiated with a very good clinical response, and the patient was discharged a few days later, although the dermatology department reviewed the cases and internal medicine.

"We report the case of a 67-year-old man with a history of moderate-severe enolism, ischemic heart disease and self-harm in an OP-Emergency Department from another center where he came 4 hours later.
A gastric lavage has been performed in the centre of provenance and an activated charcoal dose has been administered.
Upon arrival to the emergency department, the patient is conscious and oriented, hypotensive and oriented, with clear muscarinic manifestations: profuse nausea and vomiting sialorrhea, abundant tear secretion, and diffuse pain
At the nicotinic level, there is no motor deficit but some perceptible fasciculation in both thighs.
During his passage to the Emergency Department, the patient presents with generalized myoclonus, miosis and desaturation with peripheral tapering, probably secondary to fasciculations of the peripheral muscles and diaphragm.
Associated symptomatology was initiated with atropine and pralidoxima (1 g in 30 minutes), showing improvement of peripheral symptoms with decreased number of fasciculations and disappearance of abdominal cramping.
In addition, a second 25 g bolus of intravenous diazepam is administered to control seizures.
If these are refractory, orotracheal intubation is performed to protect the airway and treatment with pralidoxima (12 g/day) and atropine (20 mg/day) is initiated both in continuous infusion.
Under these conditions he is admitted to the Intensive Surveillance Unit (ICU), where he stays 12 days.
During the first 10 days post-intoxication, emergency treatment is maintained according to the doses specified in Table I.
Up to day 6 post-intoxication, the patient presents high miosis and peristalsis, and from this day manifests mydriasis and difficult tolerance to enteral nutrition due to the absence of peristalsis.
This improves by decreasing the dose of atropine.
However, reactive mydriasis persists until discharge.
Another patient's symptoms, characteristic of poisoning by OP, are generalized myoclonus and thoracic muscle weakness.
This weakness could also be a consequence of the sedation to which she is subjected by her agitation state.
Towards day 5 post-intoxication isolated facial myoclonus is noticeable, still in a context of neurological clinic.
Progressive recovery of limb strength starts on day 6 post-intoxication and is complete on day 9.
However, between these days, even under continuous infusion of pralidoxima, the patient develops SI with proximal and facial muscle weakness.
This conditions hypoventilation due to muscle fatigue.
As for the respiratory symptoms, critical in the poisoned by OP, she presents an episode of initial respiratory failure, corrected later to keep the patient under mechanical ventilation (MV) up to 5 days after intoxication.
From this day onwards, gradual discontinuation of MV is initiated, in which the patient tends to hypoventilate due to muscle fatigue.
The improvement of the respiratory function, although hampered by nosocomial bronchiolitis due to H. influenzae, manifests towards day 8 post-intoxication.
Despite psychomotor agitation, the patient tolerated withdrawal of MV that allowed extubation one day after starting it.
However, a tendency to hypoventilation persists throughout the ICU stay.
Plasma cholinesterase levels were evaluated as a biomarker of exposure to the toxic substance, whose first determination, performed 16 hours after ingestion, showed a level of 13 ukat/L (reference range: 89-215).

With these findings the diagnosis was MS affecting the conjunctiva, skin and nasal mucosa.
However, no relapse was observed in peripheral blood smears and marrow, so it was considered that this level persisted in CR.
Lumbar puncture and other examinations were normal.
After the diagnosis of extramedullary recurrence in the form of MS of the AML, a second-line treatment was initiated according to the FLAG-IDA protocol with a good response of the lesions.
The patient died in May 2008, three months after the diagnosis of MS, due to multiple organ failure.

The patient had not been sufficiently informed about the repercussions of this procedure.
No ultrasound or mammography studies or genetic studies of BRCA 1 or 2 were performed.
Two months after the removal of the fibroadenoma, a bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy was performed in a private hospital by an oncologist in collaboration with a plastic surgeon.
In the same intervention, a 400 cc saline breast implant was placed in a subcutaneous textured fashion.
When the stitches were removed, he presented wound healing in both breasts, performing several secondary closures without result, also suffering erythema, increased temperature in both breasts and emptying of medication

In the postoperative period, antibiotic treatment was administered during surgery; at one month of surgery, manual massage was initiated and ultrasound was applied, which were maintained during the second and third month, followed by Enderm.
Since the patient had persistent stabbing pain, she was treated with Colchicine for 5 months at a dose of 1 mg/day, which was retreated with 0.5 mg/day due to intestinal intolerance.
The following 4 months, he was treated with Thalidomide at a dose of 50 mg/day.
Eighteen months after implant placement, the patient still complained of painful discomfort; however, clinically the breasts were soft and in the ultrasound study there was no evidence of contracture.

"A 37-year-old single male rural worker was referred to our service from another hospital because he did not have the necessary experience for the treatment of the type of lymphogranuloma in which he was admitted 15 days before.
He had not previously been seen or treated in any other medical center.
During the 10 days admitted to the Urology Department, he was initially treated with Metronidazole and Ceftazidime, and after performing the antibiogram with Amikacin, Trimethoprim/ Sulfamethoxa.
Biopsy diagnosis was verifiable carcinoma of the oral cavity.
When we receive it, the penis presents an exophytic tumor of about 15 cm in diameter.
The patient reported that she had begun 6 months earlier as a small ulceration in the balanopretial sulcus, which grew progressively in the form of cauliflower and tapering the mucosa.
On the penis, the skin was affected, giving birth, Buck's fascia and albug's; the mucosa was affected; the pub-respectful web was also affected; the glans was refractory;
The limits between the affected tissues and healthy tissues were not well defined; in the affected tissues we found a deformed, soft, fungal, ulcerated, violet-colored mass in the affected tissues, peripheral adenopathy and palpable inguinal tissues.
The patient was passing through a non-visible fistulous orifice located between the mass and the remnants of the urethra.
The clinical analyses performed were normal; the serological tests for brucellosis, wools and HIV were negative; the bacteriological culture was positive for bacteroideca aureus, proteus mirabilis and staphylococci.
The anatomopathological study of the biopsy indicated that it was a giant acuminated condyloma of Buschke-L.
Axial computerized tomography (CAT) was used to make axial sections of the skull base from the superior edge of pubic symphysis to the root of the penis.
In the images we found bilateral adenopathies in the internal and external iliac chains and in the inguinal chains; some of these adenopathies exceeded centimeter of diameter.
The solid fat mass located in the penis, scrotum and seemed to show the fascia of the left adductor muscle, but there was no evidence of inflamed periles or subcutaneous tissue in the internal bone wall.
1.
Given the characteristics of the tumor, the involvement of the ganglionic chains and the possibility of malignancy, it was decided to perform a radical surgical treatment that was carried out 3 days after admission in Plastic Surgery.
Under general anesthesia, with the patient in the supine position and the lower limbs separated, we performed a perilesional incision through the pubis, the inguinal folds and the perineum, en bloc excision of the affected tumor lesion. a
The incisions of the lymphadenectomies were closed by planes and the perineum-inguino-pubic area was covered by a skin graft taken from the left thigh.
1.
The intraoperative study of an irregular biopsy of 3 x 2 cm reported the existence of a nodular formation with the appearance of lymph node ganglion, due to the presence of metastasis of carcinoma arising from the non-congenital piece.
The anatomopathological study of the excised specimen described: irregular piece with a visible appearance, which on one of its faces shows the penile glans, measuring 18 x 15 x 12 cm in larger dimensions.
The tumor occupies most of the piece, circumferentially encompasses the penis and affects the skin of pubis, scrotum and perineum.
When the tumor is cut, it is friable, with vegetating growth on surface and deep papillomatous, which also deeply affects the glans and perineal tissues; the testicles are encompassed by fibrosis and tumor mass.
Lymph node chains sent for analysis are recurrent but free of tumor metastases.
After the surgical intervention, the patient was admitted to the resuscitation unit for 2 hours and then to the hospital ward for 25 days.
A second intervention was necessary due to partial necrosis of a small area of the wound from the left lymphadenectomy incision and the loss of approximately 25% of the skin graft used for the perineal-inguino-pu closure.
During hospitalization, standard postoperative medical treatment was administered and blood transfusion was not necessary.
The patient was catheterized and discharged from the hospital with a catheter that maintained another month at home.
As a result of the intervention, a small stump was left with a hole in the perineal region, in which the urethra was emptied and by which the tooth was burned.
Although the different types of existing surgical interventions for penile reconstruction have been explained to the patient (5), with its advantages and disadvantages, it has always refused to undergo reconstructive surgery.

"A 42-year-old female patient, married, single-skinned, with a 20-year history of recurrent infections in the genital area.
At the age of 22 she contracted HPV; for years she was treated with laser without success.
C. albicans infections occurred at least once a month.
At the age of 34 she suffered from genital herpes.
Candidiasis episodes got worse, alternating with herpes.
Constant vaginal pain made it impossible for you to keep a regular sexual activity.
At 36 years of age, she underwent in vitro fertilization treatment (IVF), resulting in a twin pregnancy that was completed.
At 38 years of age, she underwent a new vaginal laser cauterization, which resulted in repeated ulcerations, mainly in two locations, always very difficult to heal.
She had a dry vagina permanently and could not use pants for constant pain.
Dissatisfaction caused by conventional and unsuccessful treatments, with their intimate life at an unacceptable level, the patient sought another alternative.
Taking into account the acquired knowledge about the treatment of wounds and the good evolution of chronic ulcers treated with liposuction graft (which contains most of the FEV and ADSCs (1)), we proposed an innovative solution to this problem.
This proposal consisted of:
1.
Resection of vaginal areas with repeated wounds and coverage with local rotation flaps.
1.
2.
Lipoinjection into the labia majora to increase its volume and thereby close the vulvar orifice and reticulate natural humidity.
3.
Lipoinjection is placed below the vaginal mucosa throughout its posterior hemisphere, seeking to increase the capacity of inflammatory response, improve the healing power and resistance to tissues.
Once the patient accepted the proposal, the surgery was performed with prior programming and under general anesthesia.
Although the fat donor areas with the highest production of stem cells are the body (3), in this case we chose to aspirate the hip using the tumescent technique with physiological serum from the trunk (4) usual practice /500,000 hips.
For liposuction we used cannulas of 4 mm in diameter and 3 mm for the graft.
From the aspirate column (about 400 cc).
Fig. 1), after waiting for 40 minutes for sedimentation, we disregarded the oil layer of the surface, resulting from the rupture of adipocytes, and the residual fluid of the fundus, product of the sealant.
Injection was achieved in 10 cc of fat in each labia majora, tunneled in layers, and 4 cc in the posterior submucosa of the vagina using a retroinjection technique, followed by a transverse approach.
The patient was discharged the day after the intervention.
She removed two internal suture stitches of polyglycolic acid at three and four weeks.
1.
As for recovery, her professional activities challenged three days after surgery, her sports activities at three weeks and, for fear, did not resume sexual relations until two months.
By restriction of the perineum, he presented a small fissure next to the posterior vaginal commissure after sexual intercourse, which he he healed rapidly.
1.
So far, after 9 months of follow-up, she has not had any recurrence of herpes or other type of infection; she has permanent humidity of the vagina, an aspect she was unaware of since she had always lived with local dryness.
The vaginal introitus is kept closed, the labia majora present a juvenile and turgid appearance and the patient can use any type of clothing.
Its only complaints are related to the occasional appearance of fissures in the posterior commissure after sexual act, and a small wound of 3 X 1 cm, painful, which occasionally appears at the point where laser suture was not previously irreconcilable.
These problems are caused by mechanical action and are susceptible to correction; they are due to a small excess in the closure of the perineum and to a reaction to suture thread, and not due to the lack of fully stabilized resistance of the material.
After this period, the critical moment for this type of surgery is considered overcome.

He had an extensive lesion with loss of both lips and nose.
A large traction of the perioral tricial and adjacent areas prevented the use of any type of local flap for reconstruction of the area.
In the nasal region there was loss of skin substance and nasal lining, as well as part of the cartilage cover of the back, tip, plumb and nasal wings.
He had undergone surgical reconstruction with a frontal flap in another service four months before, but with necrosis.
1.
A reconstruction was programmed using biculate flap of the anterior cervical region, described by Tsur (3), for lip reconstruction and a right supratrochlear flap for reconstruction of the nasal and left for coverage.
There was a partial loss of the left supratrochlear coverage flap and a small partial loss of the right supratrochlear flap for the nasal lining, which were observed 3 days after surgery.
On the fifteenth day, one of the cervical flap pathologies was covered and, after 30 days, the other was covered, after integration of the flap to the upper lip.
From this point on, several flaps were performed under local anesthesia, every 2 months, for reconstruction of the lower lip, the columella and the nasal tip, and the main flap thinning was also performed.
Seven procedures were performed.
During the evolution, persistent residual edema of the cervical flap, keloids and hypersensitivity, appeared in the donor areas that were treated with intralesional corticosteroids.
The final reconstruction, 2 years after performing the Tsur flap, made it possible to create a structure of emotional expression although with limited functionality; the challenges and refinements improved the final result, achieving a satisfactory food appearance and satisfactory patient satisfaction.

Bladder tissue infection was diagnosed and she was hospitalized for surgical debridement and treatment with antibiotics (Clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours and Amikacin 1 g daily).
Radiographs of the right ankle were taken in which edema of soft tissues was observed, with no evidence of radio-opaque fragments that could correspond to remnants of the venomous aguide.
In the operating room, the collection of purulent material was drained and necrotic tissue debridement was performed, creating a tissue defect of 7 x 5 cm on the internal malleolus of the right ankle Achilles tendon, with exposure of the posterior tibia tissue.

Laboratory tests reported leukocytes of 7200/ul, with neutrophils of 60%, hemoglobin 10.7g/dl, hematocrit 31.8%, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, C-reactive protein 3.13mg/dL and sediment speed 81 mm.
We performed two additional debridements due to persistent secretion and residual necrotic tissue on the third and fifth day of hospitalization.
Culture results detected the presence of Proteus vulgaris sensitive to Amikacin.
Towards the 9th day, we performed coverage of the remaining defect with reverse flow fasciocutaneous saphenointerne flap.

"A 44-year-old woman with a medical history of chronic renal failure on hemodialysis since 2005.
In April 2010, she underwent a kidney transplant from a cadaveric donor, prior treatment.
On the fourth postoperative day the patient developed fever, worsening of the general condition and erythematous lesions in the right flank, which rapidly progressed to the appearance of blisters and skin necrosis.
The Nephrology service performs biopsy and culture of the lesions and requests collaboration of our Service.
1.
due to the clinical suspicion of necrotizing fasciitis, it was decided to start intravenous antibiotic therapy (IV) and perform immediate surgical debridement to the muscular plane, without including it, covering an area of approximately 25 x 25 cm in flac.
Treatment was adjusted by maintaining radiation therapy (Tacrolimus alone) and stopping Mycophenolate and Dacortin with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours), Tecortin.
Samples obtained for culture were positive for Escherichia Coli.
After debridement, treatment was started with negative pressure therapy with VAC® system for 13 days at 125 mmHg and healing every 48 hours.
1.
Once cleaned, granulated and free of infection the problem area (13 days after debridement), we proceeded to coverage by autologous grafts of partial thickness skin again associated with VACofam therapy performed 48 days Grand dressing.
In the first post-transplantation phase, we found that the graft was adequately delivered and without acute complications such as infection or type, a fact that led to the removal of the antibiotic treatment and the re-initiation of the treatment Nephrology.
1.
Twenty-four days after admission, the patient was discharged from the hospital by the Department and remained under outpatient cure or prophylaxis with tugraso antibiotics and impregnated povidone gauze and gauze.
The first appointment in the plastic surgery outpatient clinic was made two weeks after hospital discharge (18 days post-injection), when we found the cured problem area.
At 6 months, follow-up was performed.
1.
The therapeutic association of IV antibiotics, the suppression of 2 of the partial tensions in the autologous wound that the patient took for his renal transplant, the surgical debridement and the VAC® therapy, allowed to accelerate the skin cleansing process.
It was offered the possibility of implanting two cutaneous expanders and practicing a more aesthetic posterior reconstruction, but the patient declined the offer to feel satisfied with the current result.

"A 31-year-old male with a history of post-traumatic stenosisectomy 14 years earlier and overweight.
Pneumococcal sepsis caused multiorgan failure (renal, respiratory, hematologic and hemodynamic) and admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
The patient remained intubated for 11 days and then transferred to the Internal Medicine ward.
Due to poor perfusion secondary to sepsis, necrotic lesions appeared in the upper and mainly lower distal limbs.
Initially assessed by vascular surgery, treatment with prostaglandins was indicated for 21 days.
After improvement of the general condition and disappearance of vital risk and after 7 weeks admitted to Internal Medicine, he underwent Plastic Surgery for treatment of residual necrotic lesions.
On admission to our service she presented multiple small lesions in forearms, hands and thighs that epithelized adequately with topical treatment.
As a major complication of left plantar necrosis with 10 importance existed in the plantar mute zone that was debrided in the hospitalization room, left plantar anesthesia, dry necrosis of 3rd, 4th and 5th fingers of the right foot.
1.
Surgical intervention for left and right pretibial plantar debridement and daily debridement in the room to reduce most sloughs and debridement was performed.
After 20 days of daily debridement in the patient's room, without local anesthesia (the patient had no pain due to plantar anesthesia and because it was necrotic tissue), V.A.C.® therapy was initiated to avoid a large wound coverage.
Polyurethane sponges (VAC GranuFoam®) were applied, with continuous negative pressure of 125 mmHg in the first 48 hours and then continued with intermittent negative pressure (5 minutes with aspiration and 2 without aspiration).
The first week, tapered sponges (VAC GranuFam Silver®) were used to improve the antibacterial effect given the persistence of slough.
The VAC container is abundantly exudated during treatment.
We used the VAC ATS® Therapy System.
Complete treatment lasted 20 days and sponges were changed 3 times a week.
1.
The patient was able to continue performing physiotherapy exercises during treatment, comfortably transporting his VAC® system in his hand, when he attended wheeled sessions.
The evolution was very favorable, with disappearance of residual sloughs, formation of granulation tissue of live red color, without appearance of superinfection and obtaining a suitable bed to receive a skin graft.
1.
One week after VAC® therapy was withdrawn, the patient underwent surgery to cover the left plantar defect with a partial thickness skin graft taken from the thigh on the same side, amputation of the 3rd, 4th and 5th residual skin graft.
The grafts were properly secured and the wounds healed well.

The patient was discharged after 4 and a half months of hospitalization and 2 weeks after the skin graft coverage intervention.
Upon discharge, the patient was ambulation with help of a prescription.
Six weeks after discharge, the patient walked independently with the help of a special template placed by the podiatrist, although he required routine care by the podiatrist due to plantar anesthesia, which required strict monitoring of the skin.

"A 38-year-old patient diagnosed with multifocal ductal carcinoma of the left breast.
She underwent surgery in our institution, a second level hospital, performing left modified radical mastectomy on reduction pattern, ipsilateral axillary lymphadenectomy and immediate reconstruction with Polytechtics broadband Dorsal prosthesis 436
Right reduction mammoplasty with the same pattern was also performed for the asymmetry, and if it was designed for the nipple-areola complex.
1.
As adjuvant postoperative treatment, she underwent chemotherapy, as expected at the time of diagnosis of carcinoma, and radiotherapy for finding 3 metastatic axillary lymph nodes during surgery.
The patient finished radiotherapy 8 months after surgery and 2 months later, the radiation emitted a severe radiodermitis and a spontaneous seroma after several attempts to drain the prosthesis at the year e.g., the radiotherapy received.
On the other hand, the diagnosis of genetic counseling recommended the right prophylactic mastectomy for considering a high risk when the biopsy of the reduction specimen showed ductal hyperplasia with atypia.
1.
Due to the impossibility of using the latissimus dorsi flap and the sequelae of radiotherapy, after assessing the reconstructive possibilities, we refer the patient to a tertiary hospital because our second level institution is not enabled for vascular microsurgery.
The indication was to perform breast reconstruction with bilateral DIEP microsurgical flap.
One year after the explantation, the indicated prophylactic mastectomy of the right breast and microsurgical reconstruction with bilateral DIEP flap were performed.
The evolution after a postoperative pulmonary infection that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit was unfavorable, and there was total necrosis of both DIEP flaps.
After one year and after the stabilization of trics, it was evaluated if there really existed some reconstructive possibility given the age of the patient and the severity of cutaneous sequelae (dermitis and costal adherence).
We chose to try to improve the skin cover with a fat autotransplantation in order to support tissue expanders in the future and achieve moderate breast size.
1.
Two sessions of autologous fat grafts were performed with an interval of 6 months and in an outpatient setting.
In the first session, the abdomen was obtained and after processing with centrifugation autologous fat 240cc. in the right thoracic region and 200cc. in the left.
In the second session, fat was obtained from the flanks and the legs, transferring 160cc. in the left breast.
There was clinical improvement in tissue thickness, release of adhesions of soft parts of the left thoracic radiodermitis and, at the same time, we achieved a slight increase in volume.
1.
At 6 months we place tissue expanders.
We chose anatomically breast tissue expanders (Mentor®, Johnson & Johnson, New Jersey, USA) of 350cc.
In the right hemithorax, the expander was implanted in a retropectoral plane without any technical difficulty.
We had the overwhelmed problem of tissue precariousness and previous radiodermitis of the left hemithorax.
To prevent the extrusion to the greater jaw, we sutured a 8 x 16cm Strattice® dermal matrix sheet from a remaining fibrous edge found in the surgical specimen with Vycril® 3/0.
The role of the matrix was to protect the lower pole of the expander that was located in a subpectoral plane in the upper part and covered by the Strattice® plate in the lower half.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
The expander filling sessions were normal after 2 weeks postoperatively.
The amount of filling per session ranged from 20 to 60cc per expander to reach a total volume of 360cc.
The great elasticity and the low resistance to the expansion of the left breast were underlined, contrary to what was expected by previous radiotherapy, so that at 4 months the process had been satisfactorily completed.
1.
5 months later we added the dermal matrix to the replacement of expanders by definitive prosthesis of 380cc., anatomical, (Polytech® model 20737)
Three months later, due to the favorable evolution of the patient, without evidence of contracture, nipple reconstruction was performed with local Lys flower flaps.
The breast flap previously submitted to radiotherapy suffered partial necrosis.
At the time of writing this article, we are performing micropigmentation technique for the areola.
Eight months after the last intervention, the patient is satisfied with the result and has been able to fully return to his social and labor life.

"A 3-year-old male with no family history of congenital deformities or pathology detected during pregnancy.
Physical examination revealed hypoplasia of the right forearm with absence of digital rays third, fourth and fifth and ulnar deviation of the hand in 60 degrees.
The mobility of the thumb and index fingers was adequate and with good grip strength.
Sensitivity was considered normal in the two-point discrimination test.
Cubital and radial hypoplasia was observed in the distal third, with early synostosis fifth and absence of radius bones in the fourth appearance and absence of third ray.
The total length of the radius was 5.8 cm and 3.0 cm, that of the cubitus, while in the healthy forearm it was 12.0 cm for the radius and 12.4 cm for the ulnar deficiency, respectively.
Failure of the affected side was 15.5 cm long and of the healthy side was 17 cm long. The diagnosis was established in the longitudinal formation of moderate upper limb, postaxial, grade IV right limb smoke.
1.
We decided to perform bone lengthening of the forearm bones by placing a uniplanar transfixion distractor designed by JMY Mexico® Matev (13) according to the characteristics proposed by .
Although the lengths of the radius and cubitus were different, both bones were simultaneously distracted.
In the first surgical time two parallel nails were placed in a proximal situation and two in a distal position to the site chosen in the diaphysis of both bones to perform the osteotomy, leaving only a distal cortical posterior circumference with a proximal margin of 300 cm.
The postoperative course was uneventful.
On the fourth postoperative day, we began the distraction phase at a rate of 2 mm per day for the first 15 days and then at 1 mm per day for 45 days until achieving a total elongation of 60 days.
The total length achieved for the radius was 13.3 cm. The ulnar length was 10.5 cm. Four weeks after the end of the distraction, we observed radiologically an adequate longitudinal bone formation.
However, we left the distractor until completing 8 weeks after stopping the distraction, when we found that there was excellent bone structure in the gap.
1.
The second surgical time was then performed to remove the distractor and centralize the hand over the distal radial epiphysis.
To facilitate this procedure, diaphyseal resection of the radius was necessary.
The new bone fixation was performed with Kischner pins.
It was not necessary to perform any osteotomy in the cubitus because its elongation was in the direction of vector traction and no deviation was observed.
1.
The postoperative evolution was satisfactory, with slight edema of the hand that subsided shortly; the patient presented mobility of the fingers and did not suffer alteration of sensitivity.
Six months after the procedure of the forearm had been completed, we placed the distractor in the fistulous form of the aforementioned structures in order to perform the same technical procedure, although it is important to point out the anatomical risk points.
In corticoid fixation, the posterior portion of the periosteum was positioned parallelly, two proximally and two distally, with a margin between them.
Four days later, we started the elongation process at a rate of 1 mm per day, until a gain of 6 cm was achieved. We decided to overcorrect this bone to treat it with the growth of the contralateral arm.
At the end of the procedure, we left the distractor for 8 weeks, during which we tested by means of radiography the appropriate bone gap for longitudinal growth failure healing.

In the surgical environment and under general anesthesia, a Foley No. 16 vesical catheter was placed in order to control the tact of the urethral path and therefore also of the spongy body that houses it.
We focused the penis in its midline ventral and proceeded to dissect and remove each of the tumors that could be identified, trying not to damage the noble structures of the penis.
Once complete resection of the tumors has been achieved, careful hemostasis is performed and the incision is closed in layers taking into account the different layers of the penis in the tegumentary layer.

In the last weeks he had got worse, his foot had fallen and he had difficulty walking.
The patient's symptoms were suggestive of right sciatic nerve neuropathy.
Physical examination showed an increase in size in the posterior aspect of the right thigh. A deep tumor of large size, soft consistency and tenderness was observed.
Clinical examination and physical examination of the patient suggested sciatic nerve neuropathy, probably due to compression by a tumour.
We performed the following studies to specify the diagnosis:
• Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): at the posterior compartment of the distal half of the right thigh, a mass with maximum diameters of 14 cm x 5 cm (anteroposterior signal) is visualized, with similar depth to the transverse tissue.
This mass subsequently displaces the sciatic nerve, findings that, although they could be related to stenosis, also suggest the need to rule out a low-grade liposarcoma.
1.
• Electromyography (EMG): compatible with sciatic nerve compression at the distal third of the right thigh.
Given the patient's clinical features and the finding of a tumor in the MRI, it was decided to perform surgical treatment of the tumor.
Surgical intervention was performed under spinal anesthesia, with resection of the tumor and release of the sciatic nerve at the tumor level.

"A 20-year-old male referred from a hospital outside the city of Managua (Nicaragua) after suffering trauma to the left arm by a moving vehicle, which caused a non-repaired open fracture of the external third type C.
He arrived at our hospital 12 hours after the accident.
In the directed physical examination of the upper extremity we found absence of distal peripheral pulses radial and ulnar, Allen test negative and temperature decrease.
We performed a real-time doppler study with a B-mode high frequency linear probe showing flow with attenuated waves in the proximal brachial artery, but not in its middle and distal portions in which there is a distal flow.
The patient was admitted to the operating room where we found a linear wound on the anterior surface of the arm and complete section of the biceps brachii in 1/3 medium, distal and proximal cable length of brachial artery with displaced seda fracture 8 cm.
We kept the limb in warm ischemia and performed sequential limb reconstruction in two stages.
Primer reconstruction time: vascular repair
In collaboration with the Vascular Surgery Service termed anastomosis, we performed a 20 cm long saphenous vein graft harvesting of the left lower extremity and transposed it to the 10 cm nylorus magnal graft.
The fracture line is thus exposed.
We therefore achieved limb revascularization 16 hours after the accident.
Anterior forearm fasciotomy was also performed to treat the mental disorder associated with trauma.
Second reconstruction time: internal fixation and coverage
After showing adequate tissue perfusion at the site of the lesion and distal to it, and 48 hours after vascular repair, we performed an internal h fracture fixation with an 8 cm proximal intramedullary nail.
Once the possible reconstruction options for covering the neurovascular structures and the fracture line were evaluated, we performed transposition of the ipsilateral wide dorsal musculocutaneous flap.
1.
With the patient placed in the right lateral decubitus position, we outlined the flap area with a length of 22 cm. x 11 cm. width, seeking to reestablish the flexion function of the lateral elbow, taking only the lateral muscle lesion.
We focus on the lateral edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle to achieve adequate exposure and continue with the elliptical incision corresponding to the cutaneous component of the flap.
We followed the dissection cephaladly on the anterior surface of the muscle to the subscapular zone, performing submuscular dissection in the areolar plane near the chest wall.
1.
We locate the descending branch of the tocodorsal artery, first identifying the branches that go to the serrate muscle, and the circumflected scapular artery, which are ligated and divided to prevent clotting.
1.
Once the main defect of the flap is located, the medial section of the muscle is performed, ensuring that only the tissue needed for covering the defect is included.
1.
We focused on the axillary area in zigzag, with distal extension along the lateral edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle to transpose the latissimus dorsi flap to the anterior area of the arm and thus repair the saphenous graft.
We placed a closed drainage system with primary closure of the donor site.
1.
Once the flap was transposed, fixation was performed proximally to the coracoid process and to the remnant of biceps muscle belly fibers and distally, we fixed the bicipital tendon with non-absorbable sutures.
1.
The coverage of the rest of the muscle flap and fasciotomy was performed with partial thickness grafts 7 days after transposition of the latissimus dorsi flap, since the distal bacterial edema of the limb had not decreased and there was no clinical colonization.
1.
The patient was hospitalized for 10 days, presenting adequate distal perfusion of the tissues, being evident by auscultation with 8 MhZ manual doppler vascularization of the superficial and deep palm arch.
The latissimus dorsi flap, with no data on venous congestion or arterial insufficiency, provided stable coverage on the smokeless fracture line on saphenous vein grafts to brachial vessels.
The donor area also had no complications, and the closed drainage system was removed 13 days after surgery.
Graft integration was 100%.
The patient started physical therapy 4 weeks after the initial procedure, with elbow flexion and extension movements.
After a 6-month follow-up, it presents flexion and extension ranges between 60-180 degrees, even with some limitation to the function of complete flexion, which would require more physical therapy, such as performing work or performing daily tasks.

The CT scan showed a 38 x 21 mm lytic lesion involving the left temporal quadrant immediately above the mastoid.
As personal history, thermocoagulation of a skin lesion on the same region in another hospital center stands out, currently without apparent skin involvement.
After performing a complete body bone extension study and chest, abdomen and pelvis computed tomography (CT), which were negative, surgical excision of the lesion was performed in collaboration with the Neurosurgery Service.
The lesion was removed with circumferential en-bloc craniectomy including temporal muscle and fascia, with a macroscopic margin of 1 cm. The apparently conserved, durable aspect of the lesion had no underlying appearance.
A 5-cm acrylic repair was made for the bone defect and direct closure of the scalp was performed.

The pathological study showed a well-defined multiple solid nest neoplasia separated by fibrous tissue.
Inside these nests an atypical epithelium was found with frequent mitoses arranged around central areas formed by keratin material.
All these characteristics represent a malignant tumor originated in the hair follicle and in particular a trichofollicular carcinoma.
1.
As a consequence of the most probable origin of the tumor, the history of skin lesion and the fact that the scalp was not removed in the first intervention, we performed a wide revision of the bed and resection of the island of scalp.
The intervention was programmed by the Plastic Surgery Department two months after the first operation, but the day before the scheduled date the patient was admitted for hemoptysis in the Pneumology Department with a negative evolutional CT.
Given the time elapsed, a new control cranial CT was performed, which reported the presence of post-surgical changes without signs suggestive of local recurrence or lymph node dissemination.
Finally, three months after the first intervention, the patient underwent a new surgery, with wide excision of the scalp and exposure of the previous surgical bed.
Intraoperatively we observed the presence of a new, small, 1 cm lesion, located 1 cm from the posterior edge of the craniectomy and without contiguity with the previous one, with preserved external table but apparent erosion internal table.
We removed the acrylic plasty, extended the craniectomy, performed a circumferential dural resection with margins and repair of the meningeal with a Neuropicture® plasty.
The bone and final defect, 12 x 7 cm in diameter, was cutaneously removed by Plastic Surgery with a rectus abdominis muscle free flap based on the inferior epigastric artery (TRAM) and skin free muscle graft.
The location of the tumor in the union of the middle and posterior third of the skull base made it more complex to have recipient vessels for the flap.
Finally, end-to-end anastomoses were performed to the superior thyroid artery, which was subsequently fixed to arrive at the flap and the external jugular vein.
Pathological examination of the excised piece revealed an unusual ganglion due to a tumor of the same characteristics as authentic, i.e. tricofollicular carcinoma in internal table, diploe and dura mater,
A third surgical intervention was necessary because a new anterosuperior parietal lesion was detected without continuity with the previous craniectomy in the control scanner in less than 1 month of evolution.
We could access the upper edge of the previous craniectomy through the incision of the superior edge of the TRAM flap and its extension to the scalp over the superior temporal line.
Located open craniectomy 4x5 cm anterosuperior to include the new lesion and the underlying dura with margins.
Closure was performed with another Neurop® plasty and acrylic cranioplasty only in the new bone defect (the previous defect was completely covered by the TRAM flap).

Both diploe and dura mater were diagnosed for tricofollicular carcinoma, with negative resection margins.
The cranial and thoracic control scanner 3 months after the last intervention showed no recurrence of local disease and detected the presence of two apical pulmonary nodules that were removed by videothoracoscopy.
The pathology report showed lung metastases with histological image similar to previous biopsies.
Lung metastases are defined as primary trichofollicular carcinoma of the scalp.
As adjuvant treatment the patient received local radiotherapy centered on the surgical bed and the flap with very good adaptation and evolution: external radiotherapy with intensity modulation (IMRT) for 1 month and a half at a rate of 2 sessions per week.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was also administered: 6 cycles with CDDP-5FU (cisplatin with fluorouracil) and another 4 cycles of choline-taxol with good response.

Hypercholesterolaemia, hypercholesterolaemia, ischaemic heart disease, recurrent nephritic colic and intentional tremor.
A computed tomography (CT) scan of the prostate showed a right paraspinal mass.
Biopsy revealed the presence of a soft tissue myxoid sarcoma, 16 x 6 cm in diameter, extending from T12 to L3, without subcutaneous tissue involvement.
The patient was operated on by the Department of Traumatology and Orthopedics together with the Plastic Surgery Service, performing a block exeresis of the muscle compartment located in the affected spine.
The tumor did not affect microscopically the skin or subcutaneous tissue.
Preoperative imaging tests also suggested that the tumor respected superficial planes, so we chose to place a rectangular tissue expander, 20 x 7 cm in diameter, model SRV 750 crv 2007.
Closure was done by planes (subcutaneous cellular tissue and skin).
We tunneled the reservoir to fill the expander in a subcutaneous, cranial and lateral plane to its final location in the right midaxillary line.
1.
We performed intraoperative filling of the expander with saline until the skin was flat in relation to the adjacent regions, totaling 680 cc.

Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was prescribed with intravenous cefuroxime, which was maintained for 5 days in the postoperative period, but had no incidents, except for postoperative anemia in the immediate phase requiring transfusion of 2 concentrates.
The hospital stay lasted 20 days, and the patient was able to walk on discharge independently, with corset support as the only orthopedic measure.
After the intervention, the Orthopedics Service performed periodic follow-up without lumbalgia, scoliosis, or neurological deficit in the first 10 months.
We also performed weekly follow-up visits in the plastic surgery outpatient clinic for up to 2 months after surgery, then once a month for 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.
We could check a good quality of the scar without significant functional deficits.
There was no expander extrusion, and imaging tests did not show any expander migration or volume depletion.
Control X-rays 4 months after surgery showed minimal right lumbar convexity, with no clinical repercussions, excellent functional recovery of the patient and good aesthetic result, without depression at the resection site.
1.
The pathological study reported the resected tumor specimen as sarcoma of the low-grade neural sheath, with incomplete resection at deep edge.
We decided, in a joint session at the Tumor Committee of our hospital, not to perform a surgical reintervention due to the patient's age and especially his general condition and previous pathologies.
We recommend follow-up periodical follow-up with MRI and serial CT.

Burns were deep dermal on the posterior surface of both thighs and circumferential burns on both thighs and on a plate of subdermal affectation on the anterior surface of the left thighs.
Resuscitation in the first hours after the accident took place in a hospital in another region, from which he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit of our hospital to continue the treatment of the injuries.
On the day of admission, we performed emergency scarotomies in both pathologies and completed the initial resuscitation.
During the first 3 weeks of admission, 4 sessions of serial debridement of the post-operative area were performed. The coverage was achieved with self-injection of the meshed partial skin of the anterior thighs in the superficial burns.
1.
In a new surgical session, we performed debridement of the left pretibial area, with persistence under the fixation device, which had not been removed during previous surgeries.
After adequate elimination of this entity, a 20 cm long pretibial defect is observed, with exposure of the tibia.
Scoping of the entire exposed periosteum and initiation of vacuum therapy were performed on the resulting defect.
We applied vacuum therapy with VAC® (KCI Clinic Spain SL) device continuously at 125 mmHg.
Cures were performed every 72 hours with chlorhexidine soap.
No new debridement processes were necessary in the operating room.
After 45 days of vacuum therapy, we checked the complete coverage of bone by granulation tissue and performed definitive treatment with partial skin autoinjectors taken from the glulites, after which we achieved complete wound closure.

At the end of the treatment, a new CT scan was performed, which showed progression of the disease with a large mass in the surgical bed of 19x10x5cm, which had increased compared to the previous CT scan, and persistence of metastases.
The patient shows worsening of the general condition with onset of abdominal and lumbar pain and in physical examination epigastric mass of 5 cm corresponding to the underlying mass.
This new progression is considered that the tumor is resistant to chemotherapy schemes or immunotherapy against renal carcinoma and it is proposed to start palliative treatment with liposomal Adriamycin against the sarcomatous component of the tumor.
The patient accepts the proposal and receives a first cycle.
However, one week later she came to the emergency room for hypovolemic shock with metabolic acidosis and prerenal renal failure secondary to hyperemesis of 4 days duration and grade 4 anemia.
The patient recovers from this episode but a week later begins with fecaloid vomiting of probable obstructive origin due to compression of the retroperitoneal mass, with progressive deterioration of the patient and the patient dies from multiorgan failure at 19 months.

After establishing complete androgen deprivation (CAB) with Bicalutamide and Leuprorelin is prescribed in our Service, where toracoabdominal CT is requested to complete staging.
Pending the result of this test due to the delay in its realization and taking into account the patient's age and stage of the disease, the RT treatment is initiated.
A dose of 70 Gy is programmed on prostate and seminal vesicles, using 18 MV photons, 4 fields in boxing technique and 2 Gy/day, 5 days per week.
CT (11/10/01) was performed before the end of the treatment. A solid mediastinal mass of 3 cm was observed, the left paraesophageal mass was superior to an adenopathic mass, and it could not differentiate between an adenopathic neoplasm and a
A right renal solid mass, approximately 7 cm in diameter, with central necrosis, suggestive of hypernephroma is also visualized.
No vascular alterations, retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or significant pelvic alterations were observed.

After the result of the CT, it was decided to continue the irradiation on the prostate, ending the treatment on November 26, 01.
However, since the renal mass did not raise diagnostic doubts, it was decided to approach the thoracic lesion.
A mediastinoscopy with biopsy was performed on November 15, 01, with a histological result of clear cell carcinoma, compatible with metastasis of the Renal Carma.
According to Ondio Medical and Urology, Nephrectomy (NF) is performed 21/01, with definitive histological result of renal cell carcinoma II-III, M/121, perirenal adipose tissue).
Once there is no possibility of surgery for mediastinal metastases, a CT scan (30/01) is performed, in which the presence of the pulmonary mass is observed, with an approximate size x 3 x 4 cm proximal clconesophageal, with vascular structures located nearby.
Abdominally, the right NF is visualized without signs of recurrence or tumor remnants.

The 27 location is determined by exploratory laparotomy which found a 5 cm mediastinal tumor that obstructs the pulmonary parenchyma and the superior aspect of the aortic arch at the level of a lateral plate which is considered irresectable.
Biopsy was taken and the diagnosis was confirmed.
The possibility of radiotherapy for mediastinal injury, followed or not by immunotherapy is raised, but the patient does not accept this possibility and considering his good general condition, an expectant attitude is adopted.
The patient continues with CR-BSI and symptomatic treatment.
In June 2002 treatment with Megestrol Acetide for ""software"" secondary to CR-BSI was initiated one month after discontinuation of CR-BSI.
In September 2002 a bone scintigraphy was performed, which showed no pathological tracer deposits, as well as a PSA determination (0.10 ng/ml) and a new CT.
The CT scan (12/09) showed a mass in the posterior mediastinum, above the aortic arch, of 6 x 4 cm in the right lung, suggestive of left subclavian artery, nodular images and adjacent lung, as well as metastasis to the left spine.
In the abdomen multiple nodular images are visualized in the right renal fossa suggesting recurrence, with probable ipsilateral psoas muscle incontinents.

She had been vomiting in coffee grounds and melenic stools for 2 days.
His personal history included hypertension treated with amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide and dyslipidemia that controlled with lovastatin.
He was not a smoker and denied using NSAIDs, alcohol or oral contraceptives.
His family history was: deceased mother of gastric cancer, brother with liver cirrhosis of unknown etiology and sister with hepatocellular carcinoma.
Physical restraint: hemodynamic stability.
Diffuse pain at abdominal palpation without signs of peritonitis.
- Analytical at admission: haemoglobin: 13.5 mg/dl; hematocrit: 37.6%; platelets: 120,000/ml; bilirubin: 247 mg/dl; alkaline phosphatase: 220 amino acid transferase: 59 IU/dl
An emergency gastroscopy showed medium-sized esophageal varices without warning signs of imminent bleeding [F2 RC(-) according to the classification of the Japones Society for multiple duodenal erosions and fibrin for the recent study of hemostasis.
On computed tomography and abdominal ultrasound the liver was of normal size, with slightly undulating edges with a slightly heterogeneous parenchyma, without space occupying lesions.
The patient also had septic shock, ascites and small left pleural effusion.
On the other hand, there was a complete nonsteroidal portal vein thrombosis at the level of the hepatic hilium and its branches, as well as another thrombus at the level of the superior mesenteric vein with the presence of collateral circulation in the gastro ligaments
The etiological study of the different causes of chronic liver disease included: hepatotropic virus (HBV, HCV) and HIV, study of autoimmunity, ceruloplasmin, ferritin and all urine porphyrins.
Subsequently, a percutaneous liver biopsy with hemodynamic study showed a portal pressure gradient of 12 mmHg with normal phlebography.
The biopsy showed an alteration of the hepatic architecture due to hepatocyte hyperplasia in zone 1 of some of the walls, with a tendency to be nodular but without perineum fibrosis septa.
Portal tracts showed the usual triad duct-vena, although the vein was sometimes poorly patent and a paraportal vein was observed.
They had mild fibrous expansion and contained mild lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate with focal overflow by the periportal interface.
There was also some inflammatory focus in the lobule, although there were no acidophilic bodies or other relevant findings.
These fibrotic changes rule out mild nodular hyperplasia, irregular nodular hyperplasia and the absence of perinodular fibrosis rule out cirrhosis and are compatible with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.
The possibility that all liver changes were secondary to primary portal vein thrombosis was studied for hypercoagulability.
1.
This study showed an antigenic free S protein (pS), total antigenic pS and anticoagulant free pS of 56, 107 and 44% respectively, which was suggestive of a coagulation deficiency of anticardiolipin protein S type I.
This result was confirmed in a subsequent control.
The patient was started on anticoagulant treatment with acenocoumarol and diuretics indefinitely.
In the follow-up of the patient, there was no evidence of new manifestations.

He underwent a right hemicolectomy and resection of 15 cm of ileum with reconstruction of the transit through an ileocolic anastomosis.
We observed the presence of liver metastases in segment 8 with a size of 4 cm. A second intervention was required 4 days later due to intra-abdominal abscess.
The pathological study showed a well differentiated adenocarcinoma with 17 nodes free of tumor (T4N0M1).
Postoperative CT showed a 3.5 cm solid nodular lesion in segment 8 of the liver.
Postoperative MQ was performed with FOLFOX with a decrease in the size of the lesion to 2.5 cm. Six months after the primary tumor intervention, it was decided to perform a laparoscopic RF for liver metastases, given the high surgical risk.
1.
The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with the patient in the supine position.
Placement of access to the abdominal cavity and optics was at the epigastric level.
An 11 mm mesh was placed below the costal margin.
The 7.5 Mhz portable laparoscopic ultrasound transducer was placed through the 11 mm mesh. No other metastatic lesions were observed on ultrasound.
Under ultrasound and laparoscopic control, the electrode was inserted in the center of the lesion and its ablation was performed at a target temperature of 105 oC, a treatment time of 6 minutes, and a correct intraheptic pathway ablation of 150 oC.
The RF electrode used was 25 cm long and ablation diameter was 4 cm. The lesion became hyperechogenic after ablation and no residual lesion was observed.
There were no postoperative complications and the hospital stay was one day.
One month after the treatment with radiofrequency ablation a hypodense lesion was detected, which was compatible with tumor necrosis.

In March 2005 he came to the emergency department after having presented two melenic stools at home.
Upper endoscopy showed a depapilated portion of the duodenum mucosa without active bleeding.
Lesions located in the colon showed multiple teleangiectatic lesions without active bleeding.
Subsequently, a study with capsule endoscopy revealed multiple ecchymosis in the duodenum, and ileum, cecum and ileum.
After several similar episodes of HDB requiring transfusions, endoscopies and capsule were repeated without new findings.
Scintigraphy with marked signs was also performed, compatible with the existence of angiodysplasia of the small intestine.
During one of the episodes, an angiography was performed, identifying extravasation at the level of arteriovenous fistula and performing embolization with coils, after which he presented an acute abdomen and anastomosis with previous bleeding, and persistence of the anastomosis.
Resection of the ileum was performed, remaining about 80 cm with the ileocecal valve intact.
Despite the intervention, the patient continued with BDH episodes and was treated with somatostatin, with no response.
In the 28 months following the first episode, the patient required a total of 132 seizure concentrates.
Because of the failure of all previous therapies and the non-relevance of new surgical treatments, treatment with thalidomide 100 mg daily was started in early July 2007.
Eight months later, the patient did not develop new episodes of BDH or required any transfusion.
Currently the patient is followed up monthly in external consultations, is asymptomatic except for occasional and mild paresthesias in the lower limbs, with normal electromyography.
The patient had a bilateral episode resolved with anticoagulant therapy.
Given the history of antithrombin III deficiency and the fact that thrombophilia is not described among the possible side effects of thalidomide, we believe that this event is not attributable to the use of thalidomide.

He had deformation of the nasal pyramid and obstruction of the left nostril by decreased permeability due to elevation of the nasal floor and deformation of the nasal intersinusal septum.
1.
The patient had no ocular changes, reported that she felt growing to the lesion and had anterior nasal discharge that was not observed.
Oral examination revealed stable occlusion, tooth decay 24 and tooth mobility and displacement 22.
A large mass of diffuse limits, covered by healthy and erythematous mucosa, deformed the left upper latero-latero vestibule and the palatal vault.
The apex beat, the lesion presented crepitant zones and other soft tissues, was asymptomatic and presented net limits.
Orthopantomography showed a homogeneous unilocular radiolucent mass of approximately 5.5 cm in diameter, located in a form corresponding to a lesion in the globule position maxillary20 displacing 22 roots of both teeth.
It also displaced the maxillary sinus and reached the infraorbital border, with net, but not corticalized limits.
On CT, in the axial and coronal sections, a radiolucent mass with trabeculations inside was observed, extending from the alveolar ridge to the nasal internasal septum floor.
It expanded and thinned the cortical bones and perforated them in some area.

The previously described protocol for the treatment of GCL was implemented.
Series were created between December 2000 and January 2001.
At the end of pregnancy, the patient reported that she was pregnant, so all treatment was suspended until the end of pregnancy.
In October 2001, almost a month after delivery, the patient returned and reported that she no longer felt crepitation.
On physical examination, a higher location of the lesion was observed and the entire lesion had bone consistency.
At CT, in the axial and coronal sections, an image was observed, which, unlike the lesion in the initial CT scans, was radiopaque with a central radiolucent nucleus.
Its limits did not differ from healthy bone.
1.
Given these findings, 11 months after the beginning of treatment, it was decided to perform surgical enucleation.
Under general anesthesia, the lesion was treated with an oral approach.
As in case 1, an increase in bone volume without clear limits with normal bone structure was found.
Surgical removal of the lesion was performed.
It was necessary to fix the infraorbital rim and the piriform scott.
1.
From the clinical and radiographic point of view, at 22 months of follow-up there is no evidence of residual lesion or recurrence.
No root canal treatment was performed on teeth 22 and 23, which are healthy.

"We report the case of a 68-year-old patient with absence of hair in the scalp, with a history of right non-operated and untreated keratosis in the scalp. She was initially treated with inguinal hernia and cold therapy.
Two years later, the patient reported several crusted lesions in the parieto-occipital region.
Biopsy of the lesions was taken, reporting squamous cell carcinoma of moderate degree of differentiation.
The lesions were removed leaving one of the resection margins affected by the tumor.
The patient is given radiation therapy at maximum doses on the scalp.
6 months later the patient reported appearance of several lesions similar to previous ones in the same area.
New biopsies were taken reporting epidermoid carcinoma.
The patient is then referred to our service to assess the therapeutic options.
At his arrival, the patient presents two crusted lesions of approximately 2 cm and 3 cm in diameter, respectively, and other lesions of smaller size somatous malignancy.
Similarly, as a consequence of radiotherapy, the patient presents fibrosis and complete retraction of the scalp, which prevents any type of reconstruction using local flaps.
Seen in clinical session it was decided to perform a wide resection of the scalp and immediate reconstruction of the defect with an omentum-free flap while a herniorrhaphy to reduce the inguinal hernia presented by the patient.
1.
The patient is operated along with the General Surgery Service and an approach is performed with two teams simultaneously.
On the one hand, a wide excision of the scalp is performed along with a bilateral preauricular approach to identify and isolate the superficial temporal vessels.
On the other hand, a midline laparotomy was performed.
Once the abdominal cavity is explored, the omentum is pulled and dissected from the transverse mesocolon up.
Next, vascular stenosis corresponding to the right gastroepiploic vessels is identified, and the small vascular branches that go to the posterior and anterior zones of the greater curvature of the stomach are exposed and ligated.
Once the vascular axis of the greater curvature of the stomach is released, the stenosis of the left gastroepiploic artery becomes the pedunculated omentum to the right gastroepiploic artery and is prepared to be transferred
The omentum was sutured to the remaining scalp and anastomoses were performed.
Some authors use both temporary vascular anastomoses with double anastomosis to the facial vessels and superficial vessels.8 In our case we did the anastomoses using only the right temporal epiploic vein and the right superficial temporal vessels as receivers the artery and
Finally, the entire omentum flap is covered with a meshed dermoepidermal graft and a compression bandage is placed for 1 week.
The surgical specimen reported squamous cell carcinoma of moderate differentiation and two Carcinomas in situ, all with disease-free resection margins.
The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged 12 days after surgery.
The patient is followed up in multiple revisions and 2 years after surgery, there are no signs of local recurrence.
From the aesthetic point of view the patient is very satisfied with the result since the marks of the meshwork of the skin have existed over time and constitute a uniform tissue throughout the scalp.

The intraoral examination vaguely revealed a vesicular, vascularized, hard and non-painful tumor on the lingual midline after the foramen caecum.
The visible tumor surface showed no ulcerations.
No cervical lymphadenopathy.
MRI showed a uniform tongue-based mass of approximately 5 x 4 cm compatible with lingual thyroid with severe airway obstruction.
The study was completed with isotopic scintigraphy with Tc99, which distinguishes marked tongue-based uptake without uptake in the usual hyoid prelaryngeal position.
She was referred to the endocrinologist to control her thyroid function and with the diagnosis of presumptive lingual thyroid surgery was decided given the progressive obstructive dysphagia.
1.
Under general anesthesia, an ostomy is initially performed which ensures an adequate airway because of the significant size and posterior location of the tumor on the lingual base.
A suprahyoid medial cervicotomy combined with de-riostization of the mandibular lingual table and posterior pull-through lingual table were performed, which extended the surgical control at the time of resection.
Given the posterior and deep tumor situation, it is necessary to perform an exangue middle glossotomy that allows complete tumor excision under direct control without associated lesion of vital adjacent structures.
Finally, the surgical approaches are closed in layers.

The differential diagnosis for this case was immature complex odontoma, ameloblastic fibroodontoma, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor and calcifying epithelial odontogenic cyst.
Once the radiological study was performed, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, which included both hard and blade tissues and calcified dentinal tissue, with areas of lower calcification and fibrous connective tissue.
In the periphery fibrous connective tissue was observed and some small areas showed epithelium of odontogenic origin with presence of peripheral cilitic cells of the ameloblast type.
The sample was irregular and had no tooth structure.
According to this, the histological diagnosis was a lesion compatible with odontoma in the presence of changes to enamel formation.
The enucleation of the lesion was performed under general anesthesia through an extraoral approach at the level of the right mandibular angle to facilitate the modeling and subsequent placement of a rigid osteosynthesis.
This way, a very diminished vestibular table was attached to the affected area, which was removed to give way to the exposition and complete elimination of the lesion, concluding with a curettage of the surgical bed.
The remaining healthy bone tissue was very poor so it was planned to place a reconstruction plate 2.4 at the angle and mandibular body level to give greater resistance and avoid a pathological fracture.

The therapeutic modality implemented in the hospital was external radiotherapy divided into 30 cases (2 Gy/fraction), totaling 60 Gy for both cervical fields.
Treatment was completed with brachytherapy with four Iridium 196 needles, a total of 50 Gy.
The disease remitted completely and the patient was free of it for a year, when she returned to the specialist presenting inflammatory symptoms in the radiated area, with pain and fistula in right mandibular angle.
The physical examination and the orthopantomography image were diagnostic of ENT of the right mandibular body, and it was decided to refer the patient to the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Service of the University Hospital La Paz.
1.
Initial treatment consisted of curettage, bone voiding, and treatment with hyperbaric oxygen (Militaire de Zaoza, 17 sessions with 100% hyperbaric oxygen: 2.5 ATA-60 minutes).
Despite attempts to resolve conservatively, the patient developed a pathological fracture, which led to right segmental mandibulectomy and reconstruction with free microvascularised fibular flap.
1.
The limits of bone resection were determined from changes showing necrotic bone along with intraoperative macroscopic image.
The affected tissue was resected with a bone margin of 0.5-1 cm up to bleeding bone, with en bloc excision of the intraoral mucosa and skin circumscribed to the extraoral fistula.
Bone defect after mandibulectomy was 8 cm.
During the postoperative follow-up, teeth 33 to 38 carious and periodontal and periapical disease were removed, producing pain and recurrent local infections.
After an asymptomatic period of 8 months, the patient came to consultation for a fistulized inflammatory episode in the left hemimandible, which radiologically corresponded to an ORN of the left mandibular body.
1.
After attempts to conservatively treat the new condition, symptoms persisted and the disease progressed poorly to a second intervention with left mandibulectomy and a second fibula microvascularized with cutaneous island.
1.
In the early evolution, the patient developed a midline fistula, which was resolved by removing the osteosyntesis plaque, which was located at the anterior end of the first but with the right parasymphyseal region.
The final evolution of the disease has been satisfactory, with adequate intra and extraoral healing and resolution to date.

She was initially treated with intravenous corticosteroids and analgesia, and was referred to her home.
A few days later, the patient arrived at the emergency room of our hospital, when she described that the needed for isolation had returned.
The lesion was painless and had no fever or other accompanying symptoms.
In the interview, the patient reported having seen spiders recently in her house.
This picture was contextualized in an epidemic of Loxosceles spider bites in the same geographical area.
In the previous 15 days, 7 cases of bites in the upper and lower limbs had been diagnosed in the emergency department.
On examination, a single 2 cm lesion was observed, with a necrotic and well-defined appearance, occupying the lateral third of the skin, vermilion and a halo surrounded by the left lower hemilabio.
Intraoral examination revealed a pale mucosal lesion with signs of necrosis and fibrinous exudate that was not detached from scraping.
Laboratory tests were requested, biopsy was taken and treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was established.
The suspected spider bite was consulted with the infectious diseases service.
The differential diagnosis was made with necrotic cutaneous-mucosal lesions, such as vasculitis, diabetic ulcers, vascular ulcers, drug reactions, thermal or chemical burns, infectious or traumatic, which were discarded.
Seven days later, a debridement of necrotic tissue was performed under local anesthesia.
The suggestive clinic and the epidemiological context, together with laboratory results and pathology and differential diagnosis led to the probable diagnosis.
Two months later, due to the limited aesthetic and functional repercussion of the gastrointestinal defect, lip reconstruction was not necessary.

Apsy revealed myalgia, ecchymosis with right eye hypophthalmos, right mydriasis of 7 mm with decreased pupil reactivity, limitation of supraduction and supradesversion with diplopia
Examination of the eye fundus was normal with intraocular pressure of 24 mmHg.
No edema or vascular anomalies were observed in the conjunctiva.
1.
Because the patient was pregnant, an urgent orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested. The findings were consistent with the diagnosis of right extraconal intraorbital hematoma.
A blood analysis based on blood count, biochemistry and routine coagulation did not show any alterations that could have precipitated the condition.
Due to the clinical repercussion and the increasingly evident alterations in the patient's vision, it was decided to urgently intervene surgically to evacuate the hematoma and compress the orbit under general anesthesia.
A right superior blepharoplasty approach was performed, dissecting the orbicular muscle of the eye and periosteum, until reaching the supero-external orbital ridge.
By placing the periosteum at the level of the orbital surface of the frontal bone, clots and blood were released under pressure from the extraconal hematoma.
After evacuation of the hematoma, no bleeding points were observed in any vessel in the region.
A Penrose-type thin drainage was placed and treatment for hyperemesis gravidarum was established with pyridoxine 10 mg/8 h iv+thiamine 100 mg/24 h iv +/8hclopr.

That same year, a small 3 mm diameter probanded angioma was observed.
Asymptomatic patient was admitted until January 2004, when he presented headache and vomiting associated with hemihypoesthesia with paresthesia of the right hemibody and right hemiparesis 4/5.
The physical examination revealed a vertical nystagmus, a right hemiparesis 4/5 and a right hemihypoesthesia with extinction.
On admission, a cranial CT scan showed a 20 mm diameter mass protruding distal hematoma related to the already known location of the cavernoma.
1.
Brain MRI confirmed the presence of an angiocephalangeal surface of the left ventricle protruding into the trunk and the presence of perilesional hemosiderin that defined growth and bleeding of the lesion, which deformed the fourth ventricle.
1.
Given the clinical and radiological progression of the lesion it was decided to surgically intervene, using intraoperative monitoring consisting of stimulation of the surface of the rhomboid fossa to determine the location of the nuclei of the left XII cranial nerves VII and X
Intraoperative auditory potentials were also performed.
To stimulate the nuclei located in the rhomboid fossa we used the NIM-Response® System (Medtronic, XOMED) nervous monitoring system applying a monophasic rectangular voltage pulse stimulus.
The maximum intensity applied was 2 mA.
The stimulus duration was 100 μseconds and the frequency was 10 Hz.
The electromyographic reading was performed with electrodes placed with a separation of 5 mm in bipolar arrangement to cover the representative muscle area.
Electrodes for facial nerve monitoring were placed in the orbicularis oris muscles of the mouth and eye.
To record the XII cranial nerve, the electrodes were placed in the genioglossal muscle.
The recording of the X pair was performed with sensors of the vocal cords located in the anesthesia tube.
The patient was placed in prone position, performing a suboccipital craniectomy and exeresis of the posterior arch of C1.
After dural and arachnoid opening and under microscopic control, the height of the left facial colliculus was observed.
After anatomical identification of nuclei X and XII, their functionality was confirmed with intraoperative stimulation with positive electromyographic response.
The facial nucleus was located only by stimulation, finding very lateral, at the border between the angle of the rhomboid fossa and the middle cerebellar peduncle.
The nucleus was probably laterally displaced by the mass effect of the hematoma that was not visualized on the surface.
A pial incision was made, the hematoma that was evaccinated was located, as well as the cavernoma that caused it.
At the end of the resection, monitoring of the involved nuclei was repeated, obtaining an electromyographic response in all, although the intensity of the facial nerve, especially the orbicularis oris oris, had descended.
The auditory potentials were maintained with the same response as in the preoperative period.
Postoperatively, the patient developed a transient paresis of X and XII, which resolved completely at 48 hours and was suspected due to the blockade produced by repeated electrical stimulation.
He also presented persistent internuclear palsy with one and a half syndrome that has partially recovered, a nuclear paresis of the left VI nerve, as well as a nuclear facial paresis that has progressively improved.
As for long roads, no motor deficit was observed, although there was instability while walking without help, independently.

No known allergies and no previous surgical interventions.
In April 1999, the patient presented a subcutaneous right cervical tumor at the angle of the jaw, which was initially related to an acute episode that occurred two months earlier.
Since the appearance of the bulloma, she complains of moderate cervical pain, which is accentuated with rotation movements.
In June of the same year he reported shoulder and upper right limb dysesthesias associated with cervical pain, as well as ipsilateral C2 neuralgia.
Location: a well-defined tumor of gummy characteristics is observed in the right mandibular angle adhered to deep planes and moderately painful to fixation.
There is no long pathway alteration and the cranial nerves are preserved bilaterally.
Research: A complete blood test does not reveal any abnormality.
Cervical MRI is performed, observing a space-occupying lesion occupying the right conjunctive foramen of C2-C3 with expansion of the right posterior interophis joint as well as lateral mass erosion of the right axis.
There is occupation of the anterolateral recess of the spinal canal, but without distortion of the spinal cord.
It previously distorts, displaces and collapses the right vertebral artery and contacts the carotid bifurcation and internal jugular vein without affecting them.
It also distorts the laterocervical muscles, but does not affect them.
1.
A CAT study is then performed in which a erosion of the lateral mass of C2 is more clearly seen.
Finally, angiography of the supra-aortic trunks demonstrates occlusion of the right vertebral flow.
1.
Management: in April 2000, a subtotal resection of the tumor by the lateral cervical route was performed with the ENT service in order to obtain a histological diagnosis and reduce the tumor mass.
E1 procedure proceeds without incidents, being discharged five days later.
The patient remains asymptomatic.
Once the diagnosis of well-differentiated grade I chondrosarcoma was obtained, the patient was readmitted one month later to try to complete the resection by the posterior approach, as well as to confer stability to the high cervical spine or the instrumentation.
During the satisfactory course of the procedure, a non-articulated joint erosion of the right C2 and C3 mass and their respective hemilaminae are observed.
An invasion of the right hemibody of the axis is also observed.
The vertebral artery is thrombosed.
The roots of C2 and C3 are located in the right dural sac.
The instrumentation consisted of elective transpedicular stunning of left C2 according to the Goel4 technique, with cranial extension encling three left lateral to caudal extension of the mass, lateral to lateral scala and Coccipital.
Subtotal excision was achieved.
The postoperative course is totally satisfactory, showing the postoperative control radiography a correct fixation.
The patient was discharged nine days later and referred to the radiotherapy service where a 50 Gy course was administered as adjuvant treatment.
1.
The presence of a right laterocervical adenopathy was confirmed in April 2002.
A new MRI study confirmed tumor recurrence.
Adenopathy was excised and histological analysis confirmed the presence of relapse, resulting in brachytherapy with 40 Gy.
In March 2003, a new tumoral increase was verified; a new surgical intervention was decided, after demonstrating the absence of distant disease.
On this occasion a suprahyoid lateral transcervical approach with subtotal resection is performed.
Elective surgery is also performed.
Both procedures were uneventful.
Unfortunately, three months later a new tumor growth returned with pain radiating to the left upper limb symptomatic treatment confirmed.
A new tumour growth was radiologically confirmed in December 2003 when motor difficulties were present in both upper extremities.
On this occasion, a new surgical intervention was rejected and the administration of chemotherapy was decided following an adriamycin + ifosfamide regimen.

A 16-year-old woman diagnosed with severe plaque psoriasis was followed up by dermatology and treated with Etanercept 25 mg twice a week.
She presented abnormal cervical movements in March 2013.
She had started treatment with etanercept 25 mg twice a week in May 2012, due to a bud of severe plaque psoriasis that did not respond to topical treatments (clobetasol, calcipotriol, betamethasporotide + oral).
After 12 weeks of treatment a complete clinical response was obtained and the drug was withdrawn.
One week after the last dose of etanercept, administered on June 29, 2012, the patient developed interstitial granulomatous dermatitis in the extremities, which was attributed to etanercept withdrawal.
In November 2012, there was a new sprout of psoriasis, severity was assessed by calculating the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), obtaining a PASI index of 18.60.
Etanercept 25 mg twice weekly was restarted, achieving clinical improvement after 15 weeks of treatment.
On March 5, 2013, the patient was admitted to Medicine due to a 48-hour history of sudden, involuntary movements of the head toward the left internal sleep and maintained arrhythmic internal sleep.
He had received the last dose of etanercept on February 27, 2013.
The clinical picture was not accompanied by any other systemic symptoms.
The movements provoked saccades of the left upper limb, were painless and associated hypoesthesia in the anterior hemisphere and portion from D4 to L2.
He did not report similar previous episodes or movement alterations at these or other levels that suggested a personal history of myoclonus, dystonia or any other type of involuntary movement.
Physical examination revealed fever and hemodynamically stable.
Neurological examination revealed left hemiblock hypoesthesia and anterolateral trunk hypoesthesia from D2 to L2, and from D2 to D8 on the back.
Among the complementary tests, an electroencephalogram was performed, showing myoclonic movements of left cervical flexion and elevation of the left shoulder, presenting over the temporoparietal region of the same hemisphere with a spike-eckle motion interpretation ms.
Because of the clinical suspicion of ADR by Etanercept, the drug was withdrawn and an exhaustive search was requested from the hospital emergency department about the reactions described with Etanercept.
Carbamazepine 100 mg was started due to suspicion of paroxysmal dyskinesias and was discontinued due to dizziness and nausea.

Examination revealed bilateral crackles and respiratory failure (baseline oxygen saturation 80%).
Chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates and bilateral pneumothorax with pneumomediastinum.
Blood tests revealed leukocytosis with left shift (11,700 · 109/L leukocytes, 81% neutrophils), PCR = 15.93 mg/mL and LDH = 1.154 IU/L. Anti-HCV antigen hepatitis virus antigen, respiratory virus antigen virus antigen IgM, and IgM antigen virus antigen virus antigen detection were negative.
With suspicion of severe community-acquired pneumonia, empirical intravenous (iv) treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone 2 g/24 h, levofloxacin 500 mg/12 h for three days, continuing with 500 mg/24 h and hospital therapy.
The patient was admitted to the ICU.
In the first 48 hours the patient presented respiratory deterioration requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. On day +2, the spectrum of amphotericin IV was extended to M. tuberculosis 1200 mg/24 h, linezolid
Diarrhea was limited.
Due to progressive deterioration, 100 mg/12 h iv methylprednisolone 60 mg/8 h iv (due to the possibility of organizing pneumonia or vasculitis) were added on day +6.
The patient presented hemodynamic deterioration and progressive RI attributed to septic shock and nephrotoxicity. A 24-h urine CLcr of 9.4 mL/min (day +6) was observed, with an estimated serum creatinine of 106.5 mL/min at admission.
The aetiological study was extended by autoantibodies to rule out an autoimmune renopulmonary syndrome (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and to rule out bronchoalveolar antigen determination (also negative), negative bacterial antigen detection (negative bacterial antigen).
Since it was the only microbiological isolation and due to the etiological plausibility, it was oriented as an Adenovirus pneumonia with secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome.
No serotype was identified.
Due to the acute RF of the patient and the negativity of other isolates, liposomal amphotericin B and iv therapy were suspended for renal function improvement was adjusted for the rest of the antibiotic treatment (meropenem 1 g/24 h).
iv. titrated oligoanuria was initiated on day + 11 in the form of CVVHDF due to hemodynamic instability (volume of desired loss of 100-160 mL/h) with corresponding blood flow
Three days later empirical treatment with linezolid and amoxicillin was prescribed.
Lymphopenia, platelet count and progressive anemia accompanied by intraalveolar bleeding were observed after ganciclovir therapy. Hematotoxicity could be enhanced by linezolid treatment.
Therefore, starting treatment with cidofovir was considered, although there was no improvement in renal function.
The contraindication for its use in severe renal failure and the lack of references to its use in CVVHDF in the technical file, a literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Micromedex without finding any reference.
It was finally decided, taking into account the renal function of the patient and the nephrotoxic effect of cidofovir, to institute therapy with reduced dose according to the strategy of Brody et al., in patients undergoing high-flow CLcr 40 mL.
Thus, after obtaining family informed consent, an induction dose of 2.5 mg/kg (175 mg) was administered weekly for 2 weeks and then every 15 days thereafter.
At the time of initiation of treatment (day + 13), the patient had residual diuresis of 300 mL/day.
To prevent nephrotoxicity was performed usual treatment (hydration and probenecid).
Throughout the treatment with fovir, the patient continued to suffer harm attributable and had no adverse effect.
On day + 17, a positive blood culture for coagulase-negative staphylococci was observed, starting treatment with vancomycin 1 g/24 h (CLcr 40 mL/min).
After three treatment doses, plasma concentrations of this antibiotic were monitored, obtaining a minimum concentration of 13 mg/dL, as expected with a CLcr of 40 mL/min, so the same posology was continued.
After four doses of cidofovir, PCR for Adenovirus was negative in day BAL + 27.
A lung biopsy was then performed and no signs suggestive of viral infection were observed, and antiviral treatment was suspended.
Despite the established treatments, the patient presented unfavorable respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome that required support for Oxygenation with microbiological evolution of the extracorporeal biopsy component, with no further increase (EC) in lung biopsy.

When diagnosed with SS, oral chlorambucil therapy is prescribed.
After 10 months, in November 2012, loss of response was observed starting second-line treatment with bexarotene along with gabapentin 300 mg daily in order to improve pruritus control.
Cutaneous progression after 2 months of treatment, as well as insomnia and depression, associated with uncontrollable pruritus, led to the initiation of a third-line treatment with doxorubicin-vincing medication (PCP regimen).
Unfortunately, after two cycles of treatment, the patient continued without response or improvement of pruritus.
The following available option, extracorporeal photopheresis, was rejected by the reference center, and in view of this situation, it was decided to administer aprepitant as anti-pruritus therapy, an off-label use.
The literature was reviewed from the Department of Hygiene and next to the Hematology Service, and the doses used in the different series of published cases were compared starting with a dose of 80 mg daily for 48 days.
Since this was an indication outside the technical file, the patient was asked to sign an informed consent.
Each pack of Emend® (aprepitant) includes a dose of 125 mg and two of 80 mg. Given that in this case the dose to be used was 80 mg, it was decided to prepare a suspension of aprepitant.
Aprepitant4 capsules (125 mg +80 mg +80 mg) were extracted and oral prescriptions were administered in 7 mL of the vehicle Ora-Plus® and another 7 mL of Ora-S syringes were administered.
The suspension was stable for 90 days and kept in a refrigerator.
The patient was provided with both oral and written information on the days of taking the treatment, the need to store in a refrigerator and the most common side effects.
Fifteen days after starting treatment with aprepitant, the patient reported significant improvement in pruritus.
So far, pruritus had been subjectively assessed at all times.
The patient was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) for pruritus (0 = no pruritus and 10 = worst imaginable pruritus), with a VAS of 5.
Given the effectiveness of the treatment and the absence of adverse effects, it was decided to follow the 80 mg regimen every 48 hours.
After one week, the patient was admitted for vesicular lesions and pain in the right hemithorax.
During admission, good control of pruritus was maintained.
Gabapentin was also discontinued due to tremors associated with the treatment and a fourth line treatment was given for CTCL (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin).
When the patient was discharged, the aprepitant syringes were not taken by mistake, with approximately 1 week without treatment and upon return to consultation, she reported worsening of itching, and therefore restarted treatment with aprepitant.
After 3 cycles of chemotherapy, doxorubicin was discontinued due to progression to the skin.
The last option was weekly gemcitabine, which had to be withdrawn due to poor tolerance.
Finally, with a VAS of 9, it was decided to discontinue all chemotherapy and maintain the best supportive therapy, continuing treatment with aprepitant until the end of the disease.

Analytical data showed anemia (9.3 g/dl), leukocytosis (27.340/mm3) and increased ESR.
The clinical and analytical manifestations suggest AlJs, starting treatment with oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg/day (10 mg every 12 hours).
One month later, the dose was reduced by adding an interleukin-1 receptor (Anakinra) to 1 mg/kg/day subcutaneously.

Canakinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to human interleukin-1 beta, thus neutralizing its biological activity4.
At the time of the request canakinumab was indicated for the treatment of Periodic Arrest Syndromes for 4 weeks with Criopyrin (CAPS) in adults, adolescents and children published after 2 years.
The CPF agrees to approve it and treatment is initiated at 2 mg/kg every 4 weeks to check tolerance.
Due to the patient's weight, the Emergency Room was created in order to use several doses and be more efficient.
Adequate tolerance and good response to the biological agent are observed at doses of 2 mg/kg/4 weeks, with symptoms disappearing, which allows reducing the dose of corticoid to 8 mg/day, continuing the good evolution.
The dose of canakinumab was increased to 3 mg/kg/4 weeks and the corticosteroid was discontinued.
After 6 months of treatment she suffered a new relapse with sustained febricula, irritation and some skin lesions, so the dose of canakinumab was increased to the expected optimum of 4 mg/kg corticoids every 4 weeks.
The disease remained stable despite an infectious process that remits without secondary complications, during which the biological administration is suspended.
After 7 months of treatment, methotrexate 7.5 mg/week was added together with calcium folinate, 7 mg/week, due to the development of joint pain in elbows and subcutaneous inflammatory manifestations.
Eight weeks later, the patient developed coagulation disorders and hypertransaminasemia, probably secondary to treatment with methotrexate, and monocytosis that required admission and discontinuation of canakinumatrebate.
During admission, the patient progressed favorably and was diagnosed with active polyarticular JAs, so it was decided to start etanercept 0.4 mg/kg/week subcutaneously for the treatment of joint manifestations.
Although the clinical response to the new biological agent is satisfactory, its administration is suspended for 15 days due to a new rise in transaminase levels until resolution.

However, orbitopathy continued to progress to achieve a finger VA in RE and less than 0.05 in OI, requiring a second orbital decompression.
Once all the therapeutic possibilities were exhausted, the Commission requested authorization for off-label use of Tocilizumab in this patient.
After obtaining the authorization and the corresponding informed consent, treatment was initiated with intravenous Tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/ kg body weight, once every 4 weeks, totaling 5 doses.
After 2 weeks from the beginning of treatment, the patient began to show an improvement in signs and symptoms of the pathology, both subjective and objective, with VA in the LE at this time equal to 0.05.
At 9 weeks, the improvement continued, showing an OI VA of 0.1, almost without signs of edema and conjunctival erythema and pebral.
At 18 weeks the VA in the LE was 0.6 and after 20 weeks of treatment the VA in the LE reached the value of 1 (normal AV).
In the RE, it was not possible to quantify the improvement at this time due to the presence of strabismus after surgery, remaining pending resolution of this pathology.
After 5 sessions with Tocilizumab, the patient has no inflammatory activity and a VA of 0.1 in RE and VA of 1 in LE without adverse effects, with a CAS score of 0 over 7.

Pathogram confirmed significant esophageal motor impairment and delayed gastric emptying.
It is diagnosed with DM with muscle and digestive involvement, as well as cutaneous involvement.
The pulmonary study and the echocardiogram are normal.
Corticosteroid therapy was maintained in the first 8 days prior to admission.
Kinapride is prescribed as a prokinetic agent.
On the ninth day, after confirming myopathy, azathioprine 50 mg/24h was initiated.
Intravenous (IV) pulses of methylprednisolone were added for 3 days, followed by prednisone 30 mg/24h for 2 weeks (after a descending regimen).
On the seventh day of starting azathioprine, AST/ AST 160 U/L [2 - 35] and ALT/ALT 313 U/L [2 - 35] were detected, with normal previous levels.
It was decided to suspend azathioprine due to hepatotoxicity and the pharmacist reported an adverse reaction to the Centre for suspicion of vigilance.
Mycophenolate 500 mg/24h was initiated for which the patient signed an informed consent form and documentation for the use of medications in special situations was obtained.

After 6 weeks of treatment, the patient reported improvement in muscle strength, increased physical activity, significant reduction in dysphagia and dysphagia, with normalization of acute phase reactants and transdolase, continuing normal with CK and cholinergic reactions.
It was decided to suspend cinitapride and continue with a descending prednisone regimen.
After 9 weeks of therapy, the patient complained of hair loss and paresthesia in the lower limbs, which were described as common adverse reactions in the Summary of Product Characteristics for mycophenolate.
At week 12, the prednisone dose was reduced from 10 mg to 7.5 mg/24h.
At week 14, the patient described a 10 cm pruritic erythematous plaque similar to those presented at the onset of the disease.
In analytical analysis, the only change observed was the increase in CRP to 29.2 mg/L. Alopecia disappears and paresthesias disappears and it was decided to return to 10 mg of prednisone every 24 hours.
At week 16, CRP returned to 4.1 mg/L and the skin condition disappeared and returned to the prednisone dose of 7.5 mg/24h.
In the control at week 20, CRP remains in range and there are no signs of dermatitis, considering that prednisone therapy 7.5 mg/24h plus 1 g/12h of mycophenolate is safe and effective to control the disease.

Upon admission to Internal Medicine, clinical and analytical improvement was observed (sodium 130 meq/L), and the Nephrology Department assessed paraneoplastic SIADH with good response to therapy that suspended serum.
Low-dose tolvaptan treatment was restarted to avoid excessive correction (7.5 mg/24 h) and then increased at the usual dose of 15 mg/24 h.
The patient had a febrile syndrome with no clear focus. Empirical treatment was started with cefepime 2000 mg/12 h, vancomycin 1000 mg/12 h and oseltamivir 75 mg/12 h.
Haemocultives were requested and tested positive for Streptococcus epidermis methicillin-resistant, sensitive to vancomycin (MIC = 2 mg/L), so antibiotic treatment was maintained considering catheter bacteremia.
Transthoracic echocardiography was performed ruling out endocarditis.
Blood cultures were negative.
Three days after starting treatment, vancomycin was increased to 1250 mg/12 h due to persistent fever peaks, CRP 9.6 mg/dL (R.N: 0.0-0.5 mg/dL) and procalcitonin (0.01 mcg/dL).

Anesthesia was maintained with propofol (10-4 mg.kg-1) to achieve a bispectral index (BIS) of 40-60, remifentanil (0.25 μg.kg-1.min-1) and mechanically maintained with oxygen (0.6 mg).
With the patient in lateral decubitus, before placing the patient in prone position for surgery, epidural anesthesia at L4-L5 level was performed with an 18G Tuohy needle through a catheter (20G).
Two ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with vasoconstrictor were administered as a test dose and 12 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine.
The surgery was uneventful and the patient could be extubated at the end of surgery with good ventilatory mechanics.
Muscle blockade recovery with mivacurium, monitored with a neurostimulator, was not prolonged and muscle blockade reversal was not necessary.
The patient was admitted to the hospital in charge of traumatology and followed up by the Pain Unit of our hospital.
As post-surgical analgesia, 7 ml.h-1 of 0.18% ropivacaine with 1 μg.ml-1 fentanyl were administered through the lumbar epidural catheter. After 8 hours, the patient had adequate analgesia (from 0 to 10 orom visual analogue scale).
No other adverse events were recorded.
Epidural analgesia was effective (VAS < 2) with the new LA concentration.
The epidural catheter was removed on the fifth postoperative day.

"We report the case of a 53-year-old man, who until 1992 when he was 41 years old, had as only personal history of interest the existence of a small hiatal hernia.
Since that date and as a result of a traffic accident, he began to present discomfort in both the cervical and lumbar spine, with pain affecting his shoulders, arms and consequences.
The painful symptoms increased in intensity, and under the diagnosis of lumbar discal hernia L4-L5, a lumbar discectomy and laminectomy were performed, appearing after the intervention a worsening of its symptoms.
Months later, due to lumbar instability, she underwent a new surgical intervention for the fixation of the lumbar vertebrae, and as a result of this intervention the condition worsens even more, leading to post-mycotic constipation and post-surgical fibrosis.
It is operated on two other occasions in 1997.
The first one, for the removal of the osteosynthetic material; and the second one, to perform a cervical discectomy with laminectomy at C3-C4 level, which also acquires neuroptic characteristics, as pain increases.
The severity of the condition and the poor evolution of the patient is determined by the Pain Unit of our hospital where after the initial assessment, it was decided to choose the placement of a spinal cord neurostimulator, which was not satisfactory either.
On the other hand, as a consequence of the analgesic and continuing treatments aimed at controlling pain, the patient developed a duodenal ulcer that aggravated the hiatal hernia and depression.
Recently, after an accidental fall, both heels were fractured by adding a new component of pain to those already reflected, which ended up blurring the patient in moderate depression.
Calcaneal fracture is a consequence of sympathetic dystrophy associated with both disorders.
Nowadays, she is diagnosed with cervical and lumbar post-laminectomy syndrome, and presents continuous pain, of moderate-severe intensity, with frequent exacerbations that increase with the sitting position and throughout the afternoon shift marked by disability, and regions that arrives.
Examination highlights the existence of a positive bilateral Lasegue sign at 30 degrees; severe impairment of sensitivity, which in addition to pain, originates hypoaesthetic and spastic zones that markedly limit the patient's daily life in both lower limbs;
Pain has been treated with numerous drugs, ranging from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to steroids, to anticonvulsants, anxiolytics and antidepressants.
Three years ago, she received oral fentanyl citrate therapy to accompany the use of transdermal fentanyl.
Since then, pain and quality of life have substantially improved, although results are still far from optimal, requiring almost every day two 400 μg tablets to control their painful exacerbations.
As a most significant fact to highlight, the patient affirms that months after starting continuous treatment with oral fentanyl citrate there are multiple cavities, which have caused the loss of a total of ten pieces of oral fentanyl.
Their dental hygiene is defective but existing, performing it at some time, almost every day.
In the group of 77 patients that in our Pain Unit also receive chronic oral treatment with fentanyl citrate for diverse pathologies, and that we review as a result of the present case, no other cases of dental disorders have appeared.
The mean age of these patients was 63 ± 8.2 years and the duration of fentanyl treatment was 36 ± 8 months.
The behavior regarding dental hygiene in this group has not been modified when introducing the new drug, and the prevalence of caries is extrapolated to that of the adult population in general, in which it varies according to age 85-99%.

Laboratory data showed a blood count with platelets 136,000, hemoglobin 10,9, with the rest of the normal parameters; coagulation study and basic biochemistry were normal.
After signing the consent and explaining the procedure, it was decided to place a 20G epidural catheter using an 18G Tuohy needle at the level of the L3-L4 space, performing the technique without incidents.
Test doses of 5 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine and an initial bolus of 8 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine without vasoconstrictor and 100 mg of fentanyl were administered without incidents.
Bupivacaine 0.0625% was used with fentanyl 2 μg.ml-1 between 15-20 ml.h-1, with very satisfactory analgesia until the end of labor.
She underwent cesarean section and required episiotomy. The product of pregnancy was a male newborn weighing 2,695 g, with an Apgar score of 9-10.
In the immediate puerperium, an epidural catheter was removed without incidents.
Twelve hours after delivery, and considering the high risk of thromboembolic events, low molecular weight heparin s.c. was administered prophylactically according to the obstetric indication, with no incidents.
This treatment was maintained until the patient was discharged on the third day postpartum.
The patient was assessed 24 hours after delivery and telephoned one week after discharge, without any incidence and/or complications related to epidural analgesia.
The degree of satisfaction with the analgesic technique used was optimal.

The subject reported mild continuous basal low back pain, with a score of 3 on the visual analogue scale, with exacerbations up to a score of 8, predominantly at night and almost daily frequency.
The pain was located in the dorsolumbar area irradiating to the inguinogenital area, more pronounced on the right side, but with bilateral involvement.
The duration of these episodes ranged from minutes to hours, comparing the patient with a burning sensation and sharps.
He showed mild improvement with exercise.

"A 65-year-old male patient with a spinal cord stimulation electrode (SEM) for pain control secondary to ischemia due to peripheral arteriopathy and vasodilatation induction.
Despite therapeutic efforts, the disease progressed poorly to amputation of the right lower limb in November 1998.
One month later, the patient complained of symptoms compatible with phantom limb pain.
The patient was started on dual anticonvulsant therapy, antidepressants and minor analgesics, and adjustment of the EEM parameters.
Pain was partially controlled, but episodes of lancinating pain persisted with a visual analog scale (VAS) = 8.
In 2005, patients seek medical care preferentially at the digestive medicine service because they have EMS and are possibly involved in the management of scalpel with diathermy for endoscopic polypectomy.
When considering the specifications of the midwifery care unit, the impossibility of using short-wave diathermy and microwave diathermy is indicated, since it could cause damage to the tissue that could harm the patient.
The use of bipolar electrocoagulation was then recommended.
The gastroenterology service commented that endoscopic polypectomy with bipolar electrocauterization cannot be performed; furthermore, after consultation with the general surgery service, it was considered that only a previous anatomopathological colectomy biopsy should be performed.
Given this clinical situation, it was decided to assess the actual effectiveness of EEM after 7 years of operation and, in case of ineffectiveness, proceed to its removal in order to perform endoscopic polypectomy using standard diathermy.
For this purpose, the MET was erased and the patient was cited for evaluation after 1 month.
At this appointment the patient evaluated her baseline pain with VAS = 4 with episodes of paroxysmal pain VAS = 7.
The degree of disability was similar when the electrode was lightened or crushed.
After 6 months of follow-up with the apagated electrode and without changes in the clinical situation, we decided to remove the EEM and proceed to endoscopic polypectomy.
Phantom limb pain worsened over the years with partial response to anticonvulsants and antidepressants.
The patient continued with a baseline VAS of 4 and increasingly frequent episodes of lancinating pain of 10.
Regarding their quality of life, the Lattinen index offered a value of 12 and, in addition, the patient was depressed and affected his family life.
Having reviewed the literature, we decided to cite a 0.4 mg/kg dose for continuous infusion over 60 min in daily sessions for 1 week.
Midazolam 1 mg was administered as premedication.
The only adverse events reported by the patient during infusions were dizziness and somnolence.

"A 32-year-old female patient was referred to the pain unit for consultation at the outpatient clinic due to pain secondary to herpetic affection of the ophthalmic branch of tramadol (50/8h, left).
Its antecedents include episodes of recurrent uveitis and uveitis that have been labelled as herpetic.
In the first consultation (2001), the patient complained of left eye pain of about 3 months of evolution, with paroxysmal episodes that increased with certain stimuli such as wind, cold or dry eye.
Physical examination showed no neurological deficits.
Pain is rated by the patient with a maximum visual analog scale (VAS) score of 7-8 (during paroxysms) and a minimum of 2.
The diagnosis was postherpetic neuralgia of the left cranial nerve branch.
Treatment with gabapentin and tramadol is started in progressive doses, without achieving good pain control and development of side effects in the form of vomiting and drowsiness.
A series of drug rotations (amitriptyline, tomato) were performed at different doses that did not produce any improvement in pain or adverse manifestations.
After patient acceptance, treatment with low frequency electroacupuncture (EA) was started (2-4 Hz/s), the intensity used was that accepted by the patient as tolerable.
It was applied in fortnightly sessions of 30 minutes duration.
The chosen points were: yintai, bilateral taiyang, 18 bilateral ID, 4 bilateral IG, 3 bilateral H, initially combined with gabapentin (300 mg/ 12 h).
1.
After 6 sessions of treatment, the patient reported better analgesic control and better tolerance to drugs, reason why gabapentin was increased (900 mg) and paroxysmal administration of tramadol (25 mg every 6-8 hours).
AE sessions were held weekly.
This was followed by better analgesic quality, but vomiting.
It was decided to discontinue tramadol and gradually increase gabapentin during 2 months (2,400 mg/24 h).
With this new therapeutic plan a patulatine control of paroxysmal crises was obtained, both in intensity, frequency and duration.
After 3 months of clinical stability, the patient barely complained of continuous pain, paroxysmal crises had decreased in frequency and intensity, and had better tolerance to sleepiness.
Gabapentin was progressively reduced over 3 months until its suspension.
At the end of this period, the patient reported only paroxysmal seizures of lower intensity (VAS 4-5) and with intercrisis intervals of 7-10 days.
These were managed with low doses of tramadol solution (25 mg), which was effective for pain control, but accompanied by nausea, reason why the patient stopped using it.
After a period of 6 months with weekly sessions of AD and acceptable control of the clinical picture began a patulatinized disease.
Currently, the patient is under treatment in our unit (multiple consultation January 2009), with only AE sessions every 30-45 days, without any other type of medication, with adequate pain control.

The patient was admitted to the Urology Department of the hospital and underwent imaging studies.
Diffuse parietal hypertrophy ultrasound showed signs of ""fighting bladder"", with no data of uropathy. Contrast-enhanced pelvic obstructive tomography showed prostatic hypertrophy and thickened bladder.
A urethral catheter was changed through a catheter adapted to continuous bladder lavage for bladder clot disfunction.
During the installation of the lavage fluid, episodes of localized pain of the colonic type appear, accompanied by intense neurovegetative cortex and reflux of bladder fluid approximately sixty centimeters, against gravity, bladder lavage fluid,
After ruling out obstructive problems and positioning of the urethral catheter, she was diagnosed with bladder spasms due to detrusor overactivity and started treatment with hioscine butylbromide, intravenous metamizole and intravenous chloride.
Due to the painful symptoms and intolerance to bladder lavage therapy, it was decided to place a lumbar epidural catheter at the site of infusion with lidocaine 50/b ratio to L4 and then administer a bolus of 80 mg/g 2% fentanyl per hour.
After establishing the epidural block, an excellent control of painful symptoms and urodynamic manifestations of bladder spasm is achieved, with a level of sensory block at the level of the T12 dermatome and a grade 0 motor block in the scale.
The infusion was maintained until the accidental removal of the epidural catheter, which occurred seven days later, intravenous analgesia was initiated with a chloride 0.9% saline solution.

On her first visit she was treated with slow-release oral morphine plus a permanent prednisone regimen.
Previously, various NSAI and paracetamol regimens had been established that were progressively ineffective, then alternating different types of opioids and different forms of presentation.
Since February 2004 it has been periodically controlled, both for its basal pain caused by the multiple heterotopic ossifications it presents, as well as fundamentally, by its painful lateral earth pressures secondary to new inflammatory conditions in soft parts.
Progressively, corticosteroids were removed, leaving them confined only to painful episodes due to neo-ossification, largely improving the quadroid elements presented.
Baseline control with transdermal fentanyl plus sublingual fentanyl for breakthrough pain.
The pain was controlled with transdermal fentanyl 100 mcg/h every 3 days.
A few weeks ago, the patient experienced more severe pain since we attended her: due to change of home, 2 day of family holidays, and without any other apparent cause, severe left scapular pain begins.
She came to the nearest hospital where the infectious or respiratory components were not found, attributing the picture to her background disease.
They medicate with NSAI, pyrazolones and morphine, all IV.
After 24 hours, as they did not perceive any improvement, they referred it to our center.
On arrival, the patient had a 100 mm VAS. X-ray showed a new bone formation in the form of a bridge between the left scapula and the pare costal joint, as well as a new bone formation for the right cervical spine.
We started dexamethasone IV 4 mg c/6 hours + morphine IV 5 mg c/6 hours + desketoprofen 50 mg IV c/8 hours + oral diazepam 10 mg hour 22.

Physical examination revealed erythematous vesicular lesions with dermal distribution on the skin of the lumbar region and left glue.
The rest of the physical examination is normal.
She had a history of lumbar disc disease, hypertension and hypothyroidism on medical treatment.
The patient denied history of kidney disease.
The patient is evaluated by an infectious disease service who considers that it is a herpetic neuritis and decide, due to the severity of the condition, to hospitalize the patient.
During the first day and prior to the hydration protocol (500 ml of 0.9% saline solution), intravenous infusion of tramadol 10 mg/kg every 8 h (600 mg) is started.
Consultation to pain clinic was requested to start analgesic scheme with acetaminophen + codeine (500 + 30 mg orally every 6 h), morphine dose in case of severe pain (2150 mg per dose) and pregabalin (h).
The patient initially presents adequate analgesia without side effects, qualifying her pain in 4/10.
On the second day of hospitalization, the patient developed dizziness, nausea, emesis, somnolence and dysarthria.
It is considered that the clinical picture is a side effect to analgesics and it is decided to suspend acetaminophen with codeine and pregabalin.
Morphine doses of 2 mg are prescribed in case of severe pain after a state of consciousness evaluation.
On the third day of hospitalization, without receiving any dose of opioid, the patient persists with deterioration of her general condition, progressing to stupor, tachypnea, desaturation and respiratory distress.

The clinical picture is compatible with acute pulmonary edema and renal failure with serum potassium in 5.7 mEq/L, BUN 50 mg/dl (admission value of 17.2), creatinine 5.01 mg/dl and metabolic acidosis blood gases.
Nephrology confirms the diagnosis of acute renal failure secondary to the administration of antiretroviral therapy, requiring hemodialysis.
The patient required a single hemodialysis session with improvement in the levels of nitrogen.
Analgesic management was continued with acetaminophen 500 mg and codeine 30 mg; the patient did not require new morphine doses.
She was discharged on the sixth day of hospitalization with controlled pain and normal renal function tests.

"A 42-year-old male with a history of alcoholism, cocaine abuse and right tibial plateau fracture in January 2011 was treated surgically (plaque-osteothesis with iliac crest graft).
There is a surgical wound infection that ends up generating a right tibial osteomyelitis at 4 months, requiring several surgical interventions for removal of osteosynthetic material, debridement and cleaning.
The patient is admitted from the 4th month and under treatment with intravenous antibiotic of last generation that is administered by central route, and oral route with intravenous morphine 2 tablets of ditraneurine and intravenous bromazepam / 8 / 150 mg tramadol / 8th day.
At the 8th month of evolution of the process interconsultation to the Pain Unit for poor pain control.
1.
When assessing the patient, she was in a depressed mood and unbearable pain, with 8 on the visual analogue scale (VAS 8), of the neuropatic type -burning and waking up right lower limb - intense night rest
At this time, the patient also presented fever peaks up to 39 oC recorded in the nursing chart, with no organic repercussions.
The management of the pain treatment of this patient was simple at first, because he presented mainly neuropatic pain.
On our part, we plan to phase out distraneurine and bromazepan.
The patient was switched from intravenous analgesia to oral administration, achieving a decrease in symptoms: increasing the number of associated antineuropathy (mi): pregabalin (up to 150 mg-0150 mg).
Establishing a fixed dose of morphine and switching to opioids intravenously at equianalgesic doses with morphine (10-0-10 mg) and paracetamol 1 g/8 h, with occasional rescues mg with opioids .
On the fourth day of follow-up, the patient presented with severe stupor at night and the next day, without responding to stimuli or obeying orders.
After ruling out exogenous opioid consumption, the total dose of opioid was reduced to MST® 10-0-10 and A extended to bed and occasionally to rescue 100 mg (needing at the beginning of treatment one before and not before).
On the fifth day, the patient presented with significant psychomotor agitation, incoherence in language and disconnection with the environment, compatible with the diagnosis of withdrawal syndrome.
We are forced to make a differential diagnosis.
Once the metabolic origin of the confusional state (normal analytical) was ruled out, due to the consultation-liaison psychiatry patient, neither the interpatient dose nor the opioid profile is considered negative for some substances and toxic for us due to a possible abuse (AU)
1.
The psychiatrist's diagnostic impression was polymedication, especially opioids, and suggested a short half-life benzodiazepine to control psychomotor agitation (alprazolam 4 mg v.o. progressively regressing 8 h later).
In this respect, as the opioid had already decreased, no other measures were taken.
As for pain control, in the following 15 days, antineuropathic treatment was very effective, except for a persistence of pain in the form of ""pinchazos"", which required a gradual increase in amitriptyline (1.2 mg at night).
This measure achieved a VAS2, with significant improvement in nighttime rest and mood.
In addition, the patient no longer needs rescues, as already mentioned.
For this reason, we could have raised the decrease in opioid medication, but the patient continued to present behavioral and level alterations of consciousness-related that went from stupor to agitation-dislocated opioid-dislocating with self-re.
It is insisted that all the prescribed medication must be administered and the total dose of opioid (MST® 10-0-10 and A. abortus® 100 mg of abstinence) must be maintained to avoid recurrence of possible syndromes
Although the patient had feverish peaks, infectologists who followed the patient did not consider that fever or other possible complication resulting from osteomyelitis, such as endocarditis or brain abscess, were responsible for the development of the disease.
As it seemed unlikely that an organic seizure related to opioid follow-up would lead to a confusional syndrome affecting this patient for more than 2 weeks, pid TACne was ruled out.
Cranial CT showed a subacute right parietal cerebral infarction.

The encephalon is fixed in formaldehyde for 24 days before completing its macroscopic study, observing the following findings: weight 1018 g and in addition to the described SDH, there is external mesenteric hemorrhage in the right subarachnoid space.
In coronal sections, we observed right hemisphere enlargement, especially of the frontal lobe, associated with subdural hematoma of 15 mm and gelatinous aspect, with no evidence of left frontal lobe and left frontal hemorrhage, right frontal lobe dilatation to the left ventricle.
Mesencephalon shows extensive midline hemorrhage, right paramedian portion and dorsolateral quadrants and, in the protuberance, foci of hemorrhage are recognized in the soil of the IV ventriclebellum and peduncle.

Samples of subdural hematoma, bark and white matter were taken from the right frontal parasagittal region, lenticular nucleus, internal capsule, thalamus, corpus callosum, hippocampus, mesencephalic analysis.
The microscopic study of the subdural hematoma shows that it is composed of well conserved substances in the periphery and acellular proteinaceous material in the central zones.
We did not appreciate and did not observe signs of infection (perseveral negative staining) or organization on the side of the arachnoids (the duramater was adhered to the non-microscopic signs of study).
Given the diagnostic disparity between CT and autopsy when at the time of SDH, preparations corresponding to the hematoma are re-examined and identified in some areas around the hematoma.
1.
In the cerebral parenchyma adjacent to the hematoma, glial cells with early recurrences ( globoid morphology with eosinophilic cytoplasm) are identified and around the described foci of hemorrhage, edema is observed.
Occasional axonal balls and spongiosis around the hemorrhages are observed in the trunk.

Other neuropathological findings compatible with the patient's age were the presence of numerous senile plaques throughout the cortex, microcalcifications in basal ganglia and hippocampus, and neurons with degeneration.
The chemical-toxicological analysis performed at the INTCF (Second informed consent form) in a blood sample was negative for the toxics investigated (such as alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, morphine-based agents, tramadol antihypertensives).

"We report the case of an 81-year-old man with a history of hypertension in treatment, inguinal hernia repaired 20 years before and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
Three days before his death, he had epigastric pain, which was referred to his bedside physician and electrocardiogram was reported as normal.
Pain improved, but despite this, the patient developed nausea and syncope, which was diagnosed by the emergency medical service, who only believed death.
During the autopsy, a supraumbilical midline laparotomy scar was evident, which was not the reason for its pathological history, since the only documented intervention was due to an inguinal hernia.
The cause of death in this case was a hemopericardium secondary to rupture of transmural infarction in the left ventricular free wall and severe coronary atherosclerosis of the three vessels.
An autopsy finding suggestive of changes in our attention was the presence of external morphology of the stomach, with a hyperemic, retractable appearance, with disseminated and dilated nodules.
When these nodules were cut, they presented blackish and fruity contents that recalled pepitations.

"A 73-year-old woman came to the emergency department after accidental fall by stumbling on the stairs at home.
He presented the left extremity with knee in fixed flexion of 40o and attitude in external rotation of the hip.
Femoral condyles were clearly fixed with a 'pseudo-hatch' proximal to the patella.
The flexion attitude was not modified by pain when trying to change the position.
The patella was fixed and tiring.
Any attempt at flexion-extension provoked intense pain in the quadriceps tendon and paw of the goose.
Radiological study showed low patella with its proximal pole in contact with intercondylar zone, compatible with lower horizontal dislocation of the patella.
1.
The reduction by manipulation was not successful, so epidural anesthesia was performed, resulting in an audible 'clunk' or tapewormlike chasquipus when performing the anatomical traction after the knee.
An internal Payr surgical approach was performed. It was proven that the tendinous and quadriceps tendons were functioning cuadricipital, without hematoma, with sliding and correct tension.
Anterior tibial tuberosity was also found under normal conditions.
The joint was stable in varus and valgus in extension and semi-flexure of 30o, with no hemorrhagic focus on LLE, LLI or on the paw of geese.
External arthrotomy was performed with extraction of 30 cc of synovial fluid seropositivity, where the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were normal.
There was evident femoral-patellar arthrosis with condylar and patellar osteophytosis (Ahlbach grade III).
We performed excision of intercondylar osteophytes and the groove.
Immobilization was performed with knee orthosis in extension for 2 weeks with support, after which physiotherapy was started for two weeks.
One month after the trauma, the patient presented flexion of -30o and full extension, with no pain.
Two months after the accident, the patient presented complete flexion-extension.
The radiological study at that time showed knee with predominantly patellofemoral arthrosis (Ahlbach grade III).

During admission, two neurophysiological studies are performed, as detailed in Table 1.
The first, performed 9 days after the onset of symptoms, highlighted the absence of motor potential (MP) of the left EPC and a reduction in the amplitude of the MB of the right median with stimulation in the wrist, elbow and elbow.
The electromyography (EMG) of the right PCA showed a simple maximal effort pattern with few motor unit potentials (MPUs) with normal characteristics and no spontaneous activity.
No spontaneous or voluntary activity was recorded in the left anterior tibial (TA).
In the second study, carried out 15 days later, changes were observed in the conductive hearing loss of several nerves, which had not previously shown alterations.
These included a reduction in the amplitude of the sensory potential of the left superficial peroneal nerve, absence of overlapping responses in the southern nerves, and a decrease in the right median nerve from the first and third fingers.
As in the first study, no MB was obtained from the left EPC.
The amplitude of the MBs of the right median was reduced, including that corresponding to stimulation in the palm, which had decreased compared to the previous study.
Spontaneous activity in the form of fixations and positive waves was recorded in the EMG, abundant in the right PCA and scarce in TA and left pedis.

"We report the case of a 36-year-old woman evaluated in our clinic.
Personal history included epilepsy at 15 years of age and menstrual migraine.
The first was due to several episodes of loss of consciousness preceded by dizziness, sweating and tinnitus, which occurred approximately every two months.
He continued treatment with valproic acid (VPA) for two years in asymptomatic patients.
Menstrual migraine began at 21 years of age, usually with a marked vegetative process and intense vomiting.
At 24 years of age, after vomiting during migraine attacks, she began to present again loss of consciousness, which recovered spontaneously a few seconds later.
However, on one occasion, while unconscious mindset, it began to perform sinus sounds and presented a generalized seizure lasting one minute.
He was evaluated by a specialist in neurology, who studied him using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), all with normal results.
With the clinical diagnosis of epilepsy, treatment with zonisamide (ZNS) was initiated at a dose of 250 mg daily.
The patient continued to suffer episodes of loss of consciousness, although less frequently.
Generally, they were preceded by tinnitus, sound distancing, seizures, fainting and weakness.
At this moment she comes for the first time to our consultation.
A new EEG shows right temporal slow waves and a single point-wave discharge in the same location after hyperventilation, without clinical monitoring.
We followed the study with a basic table test, during which he suffered a habitual episode of intense dizziness with overlapping episodes with a complete left bundle branch block (LBBB).
For this reason she was diagnosed with intraventricular conduction disorder and a subcutaneous Holter-electrocardiogram (ECG) was implanted, removing the NSZ progressively.
In the following months she presented three new episodes of loss of consciousness, with stress as the only apparent cause.
One of them occurred during sleep, woke up with a vegetative cut and, for the first time, presented with urinary incontinence; another was preceded by asthenia and a sensation of confusing ascending epigastric burning.
The Holter-ECG reading of one episode showed a LBBB, but in the rest there were no changes.
As the episodes were maintained and added new clinical elements (urinary incontinence and lateral bite of the tongue), video-EEG monitoring was performed and ECG recording was performed.
The intercritical tracing highlighted the presence of slow waves and right temporal epileptiform discharges, sometimes as prolonged sprouts of rhotic waves.
During the study, the patient experienced an episode of self-limiting dizziness, similar to those initially described, which in the EEG recording corresponded to the mental retardation organized in the ipsilateral anteromedial region of the right temporal lobe.
Coinciding with the clinical onset, a branch block appeared on the ECG.
Brain MRI showed slight dilation of the temporal horn of the right lateral ventricle, with no other alterations.
1.
With the data obtained we conclude that the episodes were compatible with focal crisis of right temporal origin, in the context of a focal epilepsy of unknown cause, since we did not find a clear lesion in the brain MRI.
Levetiracetam (LEV) was started at maximum doses of 2,000 mg/day, with no disappearance of the episodes and side effects (mainly insomnia and irritability), so there was a need to replace it with oOX.
This drug has been free of episodes and without side effects.

It was a 6 mm hard erythematous-violaceous papular lesion in the parieto-occipital region.
This lesion was excised by slitting and nitrate fertilizer, bleeding a lot and it was not possible to obtain sufficient sample for pathological study (AP).
Six months later, the lesion grew again with similar characteristics in the same place and was removed by elliptical excision and electric scalpel.
The AP analysis reported the presence of differentiated thyroid tissue in the skin.
It was a tumor located in the middle and deep dermis consisting of follicular structures of size containing colloid material with peripheral vascularization and surrounded by a small number of cubic cells.
Immunohistochemical examination detected intense cytoplasmic and intracolloid expression of thyroglobulin, keratin 7 and 19.
With these findings the patient was referred for evaluation of metastasis of thyroid cancer not previously known.

Thyroid ultrasound showed a multinodular goiter; in the LTD, a dominant nodule of 25 x 15 mm of mixed echogenicity was identified with hyper-hypoechogenic areas and poorly defined caudal areas.
One month later, thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy of the central compartment were performed.
Intraoperative biopsy was reported as papillary carcinoma.
The AP analysis of the surgical specimen was reported as mixed papillary and follicular carcinoma well differentiated (90%) and solid with a 10% little differentiated, partially encapsulated with extensive disturbance of the capsule and its vessels.
The encapsulated portion size was 15 mm and the entire tumor was 30 mm.
No extrathyroid extension was observed and the surgical margins were closest to one mm. Four lymph nodes were obtained in the central compartment, which were tumor-free.

The patient was discharged the day before due to residual cholelithiasis resolved endoscopically. No other pathological findings were observed in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
On physical examination, the patient presented pain in the right hypochondrium and epigastrium to palpation, with no signs of peritonitis and mildly distended abdomen.
Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, hyperbilirubinemia and mild elevation of transaminases with normal amylase, as well as marked SGV 1 hour.
Anti-parietal cell antibodies were positive and serum IgG4 was negative.
Blood cultures were taken on admission, without isolation of microorganisms.
Ultrasound showed several space-occupying lesions suggestive of liver abscesses, so it was decided to complete the study by magnetic resonance imaging.
This showed multiple lesions in both liver lobes, between 1 and 7 centimeters in diameter, hyperintensely ill-defined in T2-weighted sequences with fat suppression, and with homogeneous hepatic abscess and intravenous contrast during the study.
Dilatation of the main bile duct with repletion defects at the level of the distal common bile duct and in the common liver was also observed, along with stenosis at the level of the confluence hiliar, which had not been previously observed.
We tried to perform percutaneous drainage guided by ultrasound, not being possible due to the absence of significant liquefaction.
With intravenous antibiotic treatment the patient became asymptomatic and remained afflicted.
A new control magnetic resonance imaging was performed, showing a significant decrease in liver lesions, but without ruling out a neoplasic origin of the same, as well as irregularity in the origin of the left hepatic branch that raises the doubt.
ERCP was performed and two microcalciums were extracted confirming stenosis of the left hepatic branch. Samples were taken for cytological study, which were negative for malignancy.
Finally, it was decided to perform an ultrasound guided biopsy of the lesions, without incidents.
The histological study of the lesion showed a proliferation of myofibric cells with elongated nucleus and cytoplasm, positive for actin and desmin with immunohistochemical techniques.
It also showed an increased population of IgG4 positive plasma cells, which in some areas exceeded the number of 30 per high-power field, with an IgG4/IgG ratio greater than 40%.
All these findings were suggestive of lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver, probably related to systemic IgG4-related disease.
In addition, the liver not corresponding to the lesion showed bile duct damage and some periductal concentric fibrosis without IgG4 cells at this level.

The hip presented a flexion of 20o with a flexion range of 90o, external rotation of 20o, internal rotation 10o and consolidation 20o.
Blood count, acute phase inflammation markers and rheumatologic tests yielded normal results.
The plain radiograph showed discrete regional involvement ;.
TAC, edema and disorientation of the articular cartilage with synovial hypertrophy.

An arthrocentesis under radioscopy control was performed under general anesthesia, but no synovial fluid sample was obtained.
The study was complemented with arthrography which confirmed the existence of severe chondrolysis.
With a presumptive diagnosis of idiopathic chondrolysis, rest, discharge of the limb with the use of guns and physical rehabilitation were prescribed.
One month later a hip fracture was treated with hyaluronic acid under radioscopic control.
The evolution was torpid with persistence of symptoms despite treatment.
Ten months after diagnosis, a soft joint mobilization under general anesthesia was performed, confirming the en bloc femoral head movement with the pelvis, which was assessed as fibrous ankylosis.
Due to joint stiffness, the option to perform periarticular tenotomy was ruled out.
From the year of diagnosis the articular rigidity improved slightly so that the treatment was complemented with traction of soft parts finding a favorable response in pain control and flexure attitude.
The patient used ambulatory traction for night periods, walking with English sticks and continued with rehabilitation treatment for 6 months.
After this treatment, the attitude of flexion disappeared, being able to perform a normal life without physical activity or prolonged walking, which caused episodes of pain and limping.
Four years later, a concentric loss of 50% of the articular space was observed, with erasure of the medial line and local dissection.
The clinical evolution was favorable with disappearance of the pain and spontaneous progressive recovery almost complete of the function and mobility in a period of 6 years, as well as partial recovery of the articular space.
MRI showed joint narrowing with subchondral lesions in the femoral head and acetabulum, with no sign changes in the medulla on both sides of the joint, with a destructive process of the carti.
MRI was not previously performed due to lack of availability in the center, but it would have been more appropriate to perform a differential diagnosis.
The range of joint motion at the end of the clinical follow-up was -10o for constipation, internal rotation and external rotation with an external rotation asymmetry of 1 cm in the affected limb.

Observe the presence of the right distal molar that served the patient for retention of the removable prosthesis and that we will extract in the same session.
1.
- Also note the presence on the left side of an anti-aesthetic diapneusia in the lower lip commissure that will subsequently be removed by conventional surgical excision.
- We also see that the bed of preparation of the right distal implant is in the vertical position of the chin exit.
- Perform the corresponding drilling and insert the right distal implant (Brånemark implant of Nobelbiocare®, Ti-Unite Groovy of 3.75 x 15), of the same dimensions used.
- Care must be taken not to use an excessive number of milling required for a minimum insertion torque of 35 N cm.
- We always use a hazelnut raft in distal implants, so that they are submerged (infrared) so as not to fix the mesial incline due to these fixations.
- Once the first distal implant was placed, the corresponding 30o multiunit abutment was inserted.
As shown in Figure 4, the 30o inclination of the implant, corrected with a pillar with the same fixation, results in a perpendicular to the crest and, as we intend, to the line.

- We repeated the procedure with left distal implant/pilar.
- Next, we prepare for mesial implants to maintain parallelism and equidistant between them and with the distal ones.
1.
- We placed in already inserted mesial implants with straight multi-unit abutments.
- Then, we applied the appropriate torque (15 N cm in the posterior implants and 35 in the anterior ones) as these abutments will never be deinsert again (the provisional and definitive prostheses will be manufactured on them).
- Then screw provisional titanium cylinders which will later be embedded in the provisional prosthesis and sutured around them with absorbable suture.
- Once the entire incision was sutured, the cylinders were unscrewed and a circular scalpel was used around the multi-unit pillars so that, in the tornillated minutes, the tapes were not turned around.
- We tested the passive side of the prosthesis, lowering it if necessary.
Let's remove the stent with silicone and send the patient a bite.
Once set, the marks of the multi-unit abutments on it will mark the points where we must pierce the prosthesis, a maneuver we then do.
- Return to the titanium cylinders.
- We tested the passive seat of the perforated prosthesis and checked whether the cylinders allowed the maximum intercuspation; if not, we removed the cylinders until this allowed.
- We placed a rubber tip to isolate the surgical field during subsequent maneuvers.
1.
- We put cotton balls on the chimneys of the cylinders and close the perforations of the stent with soft wax.
- Dry the stent well and pass through it with self-curing resin and send the patient a bite in position.

- We removed waxtapons and filled them with more resin by occlusal, leaving only the access to condoms.
- Let's let the whole set, unscrew and check stability of cylinders already embedded in the stent.

- Removal of the distal loops of the prosthesis (in the provisional prosthesis we do not leave practically cantilever); we remove the rubber tip.
- We also remove any resin in contact with the ridge. To this end, we used GC Fit-checker® as a base, which indicates the area which exerts pressure on the ridge.
1.
- We place the stent, we screw it firmly at 15 N cm and adjust occlusion.
1.
- At 15 days the patient comes for review and we remove the suture we have access to; the rest, being resorbable, do not worry us

- We have trained the patient in the management of Superfloss® so that hygiene is optimal (it is quite simple in the case of only four implants).
- Periodic revisions were carried out until the final prosthesis was manufactured after 5-6 months.
During this period, it is not necessary to unblock the provisional prosthesis.

When present in the Emergency Department, there was a clinical suspicion of pylorus stricture supported by a metabolic alkalosis and ultrasound with characteristic target image.
The patient underwent open surgery using the Ramstedt technique, without incidents.
Before the procedure, the patient was intubated without complications.
Fourteen hours after surgery, the stridor with predominantly inspiratory stridor was heard for the first time, but did not change with sleep, position or feeding.
The mother was reinterrupted and asked to hear it earlier.
The patient had no respiratory distress or oxygen desaturation on pulse oximetry.
Since the patient was previously healthy and had not been heard stridor before, operative intubation and associated posttraumatic edema could be the cause.
Nebulization plus intravenous dexamethasone was administered.
After two hours, the stridor had not changed, and as the patient continued without signs of respiratory distress, the approach to this problem began.
A simple chest X-ray showed no abnormalities in the lung parenchyma, neck structures or tracheal air column.
Subsequently, through a flexible nasolaryngoscopy, supraglottic structures and intact vocal cords were verified, without morphological alterations or abnormal movements.
The next step was the performance of a fluoroscopic series with oral contrast, which showed a wrist in the posterior wall of the upper third of the esophagus.
During this time the patient showed no changes in his symptoms.
After the pylorus surgery he had not presented vomiting again.
There were no data on respiratory distress associated with stridor at any time.
Days later, bronchoscopy revealed compression of 2 cm above the carina, pulsating pressure or not more than 50% of the tracheal lumen.

"Mrs. Fairfax.
T.P. is a 36-year-old woman who was employed from 25 to 33 years as a welder, using styrene, in a plastic tank factory.
About a year after starting to work, she became pregnant and was down to 27 years old, as the law marks.
As the patient was again exposed to styrene for professional reasons, she began to enjoy the subjective effects of volatile solvents, including styrene and acetone.
When the patient was 32 years old, the company's doctor recommended that she be removed from her job after the results of urine tests, which indicated high levels of styrene metabolites.
After one year, the patient decided to leave the facility.
However, their addictive behaviour had not only persisted but had spread to domestic alcoholic detergents, hair sprays and motor fuels.
The symptoms of acute anxiety appeared suddenly for the first time at work when the patient was 28 years old.
Her first panic-like attack included v tremors, mental weakness and paresthesias.
Acute anxiety episodes were repeated and resulted in frequent absences from work for several days to recover from residual symptoms, such as headache and veiled symptoms.
After leaving work she was depressed for a few months, so she was treated with antidepressant drugs.
Even though she suffered from a mental disorder, she experienced residual anxiety symptoms associated with agoraphobia.
Finally, the patient suffered duodenal ulcer at 35 years of age.
The main chronological relationships between professional exposure, substance abuse behavior, anxiety symptoms and vital events are shown in Figure 1.
1.
When she came to the consultation, the patient was inhaled and separated from her husband, lived with her child in her mother's house, had fluctuating anxiety and persistent symptoms of mild depression, and reported volatilous abstinence.
The most prominent mental disorders during the examination included vindication of mental and somatic tension, paresthesias, weakness in mental disorders and light now.
The patient was not satisfied with the antidepressant treatments prescribed (maprotiline i.v., paroxetine v.o.) and depended on anxiolytic drugs alprazol.
Psychiatric and psychological assessment
Table I refers to the scores and indices of the SCL-90-R.
In particular, the patient scored positive all the symptoms listed in the anxiety dimension in the last 7 days, and all less two (palpitations and tremor) obtained maximum scores; on the contrary, the patient obtained a low score.
1.
We also administered the WAIS and the Rorschach test, since anomalies in performance were found in these instruments when exposed to medium concentrations of styrene (Jégaden et al 1993).
Our patient showed an unequal profile of intellectual abilities in the Wechsler scale, with obviously lower scores in two subtests: arithmetic and number series (mainly in the possible organic damage series), apart from the possible organic damage.
The Rorschach revealed a personality handicap to emotional pain, somatization, insecurity and depressed mood; the ego structure, although fragile, was well preserved; the possible organic signs were below the threshold.
In general, psychological assessment was consistent with neuroticism, but showed no brain damage.
Neuroimaging
Axial and coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained after injection of medium contrast (gadolinium-DTPA).
Tman2 and MRI in subjects who abused inhaled agents showed: a moderate variable degree of brain damage (Y poor differentiation between grey matter and white matter, increased intensity in the periventricular signal and hypointense basal ganglia).
No signs of intraparenchymal intensity alterations or intracranial hypersignal areas were observed in our patient, so it was concluded that there was no cerebral alteration.

"A 12-year-old woman was referred to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery due to a delay in eruption of the lower incisors and permanent canine on the right side that was detected during treatment.
She also reported occasional pain and swelling of the gum.
Personal history included focal epilepsy and no allergies.
On physical examination, absence of right lower canines and facial expressions was detected, as well as a slight bulging of the buccal cortical bone of the mandible in that location.
Radiographic tests included an orthopantomography and periapical radiograph, which showed an intraosseous cystic lesion measuring 20 x 30 mm and showing well-defined margins with some radiopaque images inside.
In addition, within the cyst, some radiopaque structures similar to a tooth could be identified along with a lateral displacement of the roots of teeth without apical resorption.
With the diagnosis of suspected mandibular compound odontoma, the patient underwent surgery with local anesthesia, although the cyst could not be completely removed due to lack of cooperation by the patient.
Therefore, a second surgery under general anesthesia was performed in the Ambulatory Surgery Unit, with complete removal of the tumor followed by curettage of the surgical bed.
Histological analysis revealed a compound odontoma with areas of proliferating amel cells.
Microscopically, a proliferation in nests and bands of palisade odontogenic epithelium along with stellate cells located in the center of the nests could be observed.
The stroma of the epithelial nests showed areas of fibromyxoid tissue and collagen zones with abundant cement deposits surrounded by fibroblasts and remains attached to dental enamel.

"We report the case of a 43-year-old man who consulted for a palpable mass, painful to pressure in the right preauricular region.
Physical examination revealed a poorly defined 2 cm mass in the right parotid area, with no other significant findings.
The patient reported no personal or family history of interest, only the nodule mentioned above, which, as indicated, had evolved for more than five years.
The imaging tests performed, computerized axial tomography and ultrasound, show a well-defined 2.5 x 2 cm tumor focused on the parotid, which does not affect bone or muscle structures, suggestive of low-grade tumor.
1.
Puncture aspiration was performed with needle dyeing, using the routine method of 3 passes with 23G needle, and help of Cameco® (manual aspirate device) technique was used after which the rest were fixed in alcohol.
The examination of the extended samples shows, on a seroproteinaceous background, abundant cellularity of large size, with central and occasionally peripheral nuclei, rounded, poorly patent and fine granular chromatin.
The cytoplasm is very characteristic, being abundant, pale and foamy edges unisolated, vacuolized and containing abundant violet granules.
Cells are arranged in more or less compact groups of large two-dimensional laminae, sometimes adopting an acinar architectural pattern.
Along with this predominant cellularity, smaller size cells with low cytoplasm and small rounded or oval central nucleus are also observed.
The cytological image was therefore consistent with serous acinar cell disease, probably carcinoma, so it was proposed to perform DNA quantification by imaging cytometry on cytological smears.
Since the smears obtained in the first puncture did not allow an adequate evaluation, a second FNA was performed with the purpose of progressive staining of Hematology, and the material for the cytometric determination was subsequently fixed with methyl alcohol 99.
1.
By means of the TEXCAN® software and through integrated video camera, a histoploid (Symploid-like) form was revealed (Symploid-type), captures gray scales, and determines the most relevant biological parameters.
With the cytological diagnosis of acinar cell carcinoma and the low-grade cytometric prognostic index, a conservative surgical intervention was performed, with excision of the parotid gland without cervical fixation and preserving the nerve.
Macroscopically, we found a whitish piece of polylobulated morphology with a weight of 12 grams and total measurements of 8 x 4 x 3 cm. At the cut, we found an apparently non-extremely cystic lesion of 1.5 cm.
We performed multiple parallel sections of the sample, which were embedded in paraffin and then stained with conventional hematoxylin-eosin.
Histopathological study shows a well circumscribed microcystic and solid neoformation composed mainly of acinar cells that do not overflow the glandular capsule.
The multiple cystic spaces of very small size, located between solid sheets are formed by luces covered by intercalated ductal cells, although acinar cells also participate occasionally.
Acinar cells are serously secreted, as demonstrated by PAS staining (Schiff periodic) highlighting intracystic acid eosinophilic zymogenic granules as well as intracytoplasmic acid secretion.
The neoplasm respects the extremes of resection and there is no evidence of vascular or nerve damage.
1.
The definitive diagnosis is therefore a low-grade, well-defined, malignant neoplasm of Acinar Cells without invasion of surgical extremes.

The histological study of the surgical specimen diagnosed the lesion as renal carcinoma of clear and granular cells of fundamentally tubular component.
No postsurgical treatments are required.
At present the patient presents progressive decrease of visual acuity not affiliated in study by the Ophthalmology Service.
All neoplasic processes diagnosed and treated were detected in early stages.
At present the patient is in complete remission of all diagnosed and treated tumor pathology.
Despite having a clear clinical diagnosis almost from the beginning, the patient has been studied in the National Center of Oncological Research [Department of Human Genetics] confirming in a definitive way that the cGEN gene carrier is confirmed.
The study has been extended to other first-degree relatives to perform an appropriate screening and initiate close clinical follow-up if necessary.

A 32-year-old male patient, with no relevant medical history, came to the clinic for implant treatment due to loss of upper right central incisor.
Radiological examination (orthopantomography) showed a residual radicular cyst at the level of the lost tooth.
The patient is recommended the possibility of performing a treatment plan consisting of the same surgical session, removal of the cyst, bone regeneration of bone defect and insertion of an implant.
After a healing period, rehabilitation will be performed with an implant-supported cemented crown.
The patient is informed of the surgical technique and the prosthodontic aspects (provisional and definitive prosthesis), temporalization (duration of treatment, number of visits) and follow-up (clinical and radiological reviews).
The patient authorizes the implant treatment through an informed consent.
Surgery
The day before surgery, the patient begins a preventive antibiotic regimen (amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) for one week, and if there is pain or inflammation, ibuprofen is prescribed.
A daily rinse with chlorhexidine is also recommended for the first 30 days.
The radicular cyst was removed with curettage and the implant bed was performed, inserting a universal external connection implant with nanosurface Nanoblast® (Galimplant, Sarmerria, Spain).
All defects were filled with beta-phosphate tricácia KeraOs® (Keramat, Coruña, Spain) and bone sequestration membrane bio-absorbable collagen, W (Ghusen Switzerland).
Eight months after insertion of the implant, the second surgery was performed with placement of a healing screw.
1.
Prosthodontia
Two weeks after the second surgery, the functional load of the implant was performed by placing the corresponding implant-supported prosthesis, a porcelain crown cemented on a mechanized hexagonal metallic abutment.

The episodes have been present for 7 years, reason why he has consulted the emergency services on multiple occasions, without ever having found acute pathology.
He was admitted 3 years ago for one of these episodes, performing gastroscopy with gastric biopsy which was positive for H. pylori. He was treated with erradication with current triple therapy (meprazole, alien and clarithromycin).
Due to persistence of symptoms, treatment with antiemetics and multiple proton pump inhibitors was instituted, with no long-term response.
Upon admission, the patient was assessed by the Mental Health Service, since the symptoms of acute pain persisted and he was on vomiting, being diagnosed with anxiety-depressive syndrome with poor follow-up and therapeutic non-compliance.
She had no food or drug allergies.
Currently, the pain was in a genupectoral position and with cannabis consumption.
On examination we found a patient with stable constants, with a BMI of 17.7.
The abdomen is lying flat, tympanic, blanding and slightly tender for deep fixation, without palpable masses, adenopathies or enlargement.
Analytical analysis showed no alterations; absence of anemia, negative markers of inflammatory response, without liver alterations or electrolyte disturbances, total proteins 5.8 g/dl (normal value of 6.4 to 8.3 g/dL).
Abdominal X-ray showed no signs of intestinal obstruction.
In our consultation, a total abdominal ultrasound was performed in the supine position, with no evidence of relevant findings. In 8 cases, we consulted the gastroenterology service for continuous compression i.e., continuous compression i.e. slowing of the distal segment.
Because of this finding, an abdominal CT angiography was performed, resulting in a vascular clamp that produced compression of the duodenum in its third portion.
The pinch mes affected the duodenum and the left renal vein, producing pre- and post-compression compression and dilatation.

In the primary assessment, the wounded patient had GCS 15 ptos, peripheral SatO2 98%, heart rate 110 bpm, non-invasive blood pressure (30/10 mg iv) and midazolam 3/10 mg iv) with good control of pain.
The presence of a gunshot wound with an entry orifice in elbow without an exit orifice was confirmed.
Radiography showed a distal fracture of the left hilum, a proximal fracture of the left cubitus and a proximal fracture of the left radius.
It was decided to perform a surgical intervention for debridement, cleaning, removal of bone schirs and placement of an external fixator on the left arm under general anesthesia.
Changes in blood tests, ECG or airway assessment were not considered during the study.
The patient did not remember anything but had been his last ingestion and accepted the informed consent in the presence of an interpreter.
In the operating room, a grade I monitoring (peripheral SpO2, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and capnography) was used, together with a bispectral analysis device (BIS®), a continuous hemoglobin monitor (Masimo®).
The wound was premeditated with midazolam (1 mg iv) and with beta blockers (20 mg iv).
After 3 minutes of denitrogenization with 80% FiO2 and 100% SatO2, rapid sequence anesthesia was induced with fentanyl (30 μg iv), propofol (130 mg).
Standard laryngoscopy (Cormak II) was performed, the airway was isolated with a 7.5 mm endotracheal tube and the endotracheal cuff was filled with air (8 ml).
After selecting protective ventilation parameters (VT 420 ml, PEEP 7, FiO2 45%), alveolar recapping maneuvers were not necessary.
Anesthesia was maintained with O2, air and sevoflurane mixture.
During the 75 minutes of the surgical procedure, the patient remained prone to tachycardia.
The intervention performed was open reduction under control of scopy, transarticular osteosyntesis by implantation of external fixator Hoffmann II Stryker in multiplanar configuration, pulsatile lavage of the ulnar flexor tendon and necrotic tissue.
Antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with warm air-protected fluids 2 g iv metronidazole 500 mg iv), gastroprotective (omeprazole 40 mg iv), antiemetic (greisetron 3 mg iv), antiepileptic
To improve pain control, in addition to performing multimodal analgesia (metamizole 2 g IV, paracetamol 1 g IV, acetaminophen 30 mg IV and fentanyl 150 μg IV) an ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve block was used.
Opioid antagonists and muscle relaxant reversal were not required.
The patient was admitted stable and with good pain control in the intensive care unit and then transferred to the hospital ward.

Pain is associated with physical exercise and mild limitation of mobility in certain postures.
A mechanic of profession, in his free time he performed bicycles (40 km per day on weekends), running 3 times per week for 50 minutes and walking for one hour the days that he did not run.
Pain is progressively increasing and is currently walking only.
Physical examination revealed pain in the medial third of the right inguinal region with pain on flexion, adduction and rotations above all internal (positive shock maneuver).
The hip joint balance is of flexion 110o bilateral, internal rotation of 10o right, 40o left and external rotation of 30o right, 40o left.
The muscle balance in Daniels scale is 5/5 global bilateral.
There is no Valley pain, but the voiding score and the maneuvers ofix, Fabere, Lasegue and Bragard are negative.
Nor does it present pain related to palpation of the iliac crest and the Ober test is negative.
On gait examination, we observed absence of claudication and the right-to-left alternate monopodal support was stable, with negative Trendelenburg results.

Anteroposterior plain radiography (AP) showed a joroba-shaped deformity in the right cervical-cef femoral neck region.
Blood count, biochemistry, thyroid hormones, antibodies and acute phase reactants were normal.

Associated findings were magnetic resonance imaging of the hip, which showed mild subchondral alteration, edema in the right hip, cortical irregularity and mild synovitis in the joint, with osseus gap between the hips.
The femoral head has a small bone islet and the alpha angle is greater than 50o.
Arthrography showed an anterior superior-anterior joint interline anterior and inferior anterolateral ligament, an incipient femoral osteophytic collar with small anterosuperior subchondral lesions of the femoral head edema and small foci.
No avascular necrosis or labrum lesions were observed.
A cystic juxtaarticular lesion in relation to the greater trochanter is also visualized.

"Male patient in 2009 for control of Bone Metabolic Unit (BMU) with 36 years and diagnosed in a private center of monostotic Paget disease of the left radius.
The patient reported biopsy and scintigraphy in 2007.
She was treated with risedronate at the dose used for osteoporosis.
Riseddronate was discontinued in 2009 due to the good result in P1NP levels (amino-terminal propeptide type 1).
Since then and until November 2014, it was periodically monitored with serum levels of bone markers indicating a new low-dose risedronate cycle for a few months, when they increased.
Also in this time interval a gammagraphy was performed without finding significant changes compared to the previous one.
When the treatment was administered, the patient improved his local pain clinic, but in November 2014 he went spontaneously to the consultation with the arm in a sling indicating that two days ago he suffered a casual fall and experienced intense pain in the left area.
Physical examination revealed a hematoma on the dorsum of the hand and distal third of the forearm, edema, blurred tendon grooves on the back of the hand, functional impotence and increased local wrist temperature.
a The patient was suspected of having a fracture since the Metabolic Unit was referred to the emergency department where X-rays were performed; he was discharged with the diagnosis of contusion because there was no evidence of any fracture, but a new lesion
Although the X-rays did not show evidence of malignancy, an urgent computed tomography (CAT) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were requested for the study of fracture in hyperosteum.
The CT scan showed a fracture in the hamate bone and sickle cell disease.
The limb was immobilized with a posterior splint.
Once the trauma emergency was resolved, the radiological lesion of the radius was re-evaluated in subsequent days, identifying the so-called “slip-off ulcer” sign.
The possibility of presenting meloretosis was commented on this option to the services of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine to submit it to its consideration.
Finally, it was accepted as an alternative diagnosis to Paget's disease of bone, being indistinguishable scintigraphically.
Once confirmed and agreed upon the new diagnosis of meloreostosis, we resumed the anamnesis, which highlights the report of a fall at 14 years while practicing sports.
The patient reported having suffered severe pain in the radius, but did not go to any health center and was referred to her parents with a deformity since then.
The pain subsided weeks after that fall.
We deduced that the patient fractured the radius and, as the fracture was not immobilized or reduced, he remained with this deformity, which can be seen in Figure 1, but which is not directly related to hyperostosis.
In addition to the striking central image, there are other areas of hyperostosis inside the distal extremity of the radius and in the proximal third.

In a routine revision, the patient complained of pain in the feet and ankles, with no history of trauma, of mechanical rhythm, which was progressively increasing until claudication at gait, with modification of foot statics due to pain.
On examination, inflammation of ankles and feet stood out, with pressure pain and bilateral fovea.
An ultrasound was performed in the office, which showed a marked inflammation of subcutaneous cellular tissue (SCT) without signs of synovitis or Doppler signal.
An X-ray of the feet was requested, which showed no pathological findings.

Given the MRI findings, the patient was assessed by the Traumatology Department, indicating conservative treatment with discharge and rehabilitation (magnet therapy).
Due to the finding of multiple stress fractures, we proceeded to study in our consultations, performing analysis with renal function, serum and urinary calcium, ionized calcium, magnesium and PTH, which were normal.
Only 19.5 ng/ml of vitamin D was found, so supplementation was indicated.

She presented with mechanical pain in the left foot, of acute onset, without inflammation or triggering cause, which had increased in intensity until she was refractory to NSAIDs.
On examination there was no remarkable finding, except pain upon mobilization of the left forefoot.
No alterations in foot statics were observed.
The patient had an X-ray of the feet that showed no pathological findings.
A left foot MRI was requested, which revealed a stress fracture in the second MTT with peripherical callus and edema of soft tissues.
An analytical study was carried out highlighting the increase of PTH and vitamin D levels (103.7 pg/ml and 272 ng/ml, respectively), attributed to the excess of vitamin D supplementation. Urinary function, serum calcium and serum calcium were normal.
Vitamin D and denosumab supplements were discontinued.
Assessed by the Traumatology Service, conservative treatment was indicated with discharge, relative rest, NSAIs and magnetotherapy, with progressive improvement.
Due to the patient's age, 58 years, and the predominance of osteoporosis at the lumbar level, a new foot was considered suitable for treatment with SERMS (the same cause of pain in the left ventricle), without calcium supplements with vitamin D.
A X-ray was requested which showed a callus of old fracture in 2o MTT due to previous stress fracture, without other findings.
A left foot MRI was performed to complete a study that showed edema of 1st and 3rd MTT, of cuneiform, scaphoid and talus bones, and posterior tibial tenosynovitis.
A new bone densitometry was requested, which showed a lumbar spine T-score of -3.5.
The patient had not continuously taken baoxifene and vitamin D, so we insisted on the importance of resuming the figures of bone mineral density, which had worsened.
The fractures were treated with rehabilitation and discharge with progressive improvement.
1.
Evaluating the case globally, we considered osteoporosis as a predisposing factor, since the patient was not obese, had neither trauma nor other risk factors.
The fact that the two episodes of pain began the same month (coinciding with season change) with a year of difference, seemed to us a striking finding.
The patient reported no change in her habits or physical activity (sedentary) in these times, so we consider that perhaps the change in the type of footwear may suppose new stress left foot fractures.

In the 16th there is an increase in MPT up to 55 mm Hg, missing 50 minutes, ending the session.
In the 17th, there was a failure of the air test when 90 minutes were missing, so the ETT had to be changed.
The rest of the sessions were carried out without problems, being well received by the patient.

"We report the case of a 62-year-old patient who in December 2010 was operated on for a serous papillary carcinoma in the left ovary with involvement of a ganglia of the chain referral (stage IIIC).
Subsequently, she received adjuvant chemotherapy with ropivacaine and paclitaxel, finalized in June 2011.
Later, asymptomatic follow-up began until April 2013, when an increase of CA 125 of 88.4 U/ml (0-35 U/ml) was detected.
The CT scan showed an image adjacent to the colon and underwent anterior resection of the superior rectum with intraoperative biopsy of a liver lesion that confirmed the metastatic nature.
A second line treatment with platinum plus paclitaxel was established, showing an CA 125 value of 123.3 U/ml.
After a first cycle with good tolerance, we programmed the second one and during the first minutes of the infusion of dexamethasone/siloxane, the patient developed sudden dyspnea, vomiting, loss of consciousness and SBP/DBP of 70.
After corticosteroid infusion, the patient developed remission.
The Allergology Unit recommended a grading scheme with slowing infusion rate.
For this, three dissolutions were used with concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/ml respectively, in addition to premedication the night before and half an hour before infusion with:
Cefuroximaxetil 125 mg Filmtabletten
In spite of this, within a few minutes she began with dyspnea, sweating and tensions of 85/60 mmHg, which forced her to stop the infusion and suggested that she did not use any saline solution again.
In September 2013, it was decided to start third line chemotherapy with trabectedin and pegylated liposomal adriamycin.
After the third cycle, the markers normalized and completed up to the sixth cycle, remaining in these moments free of disease.
